The bug in this code is related to how the shifting operation is implemented in the `shift_register` module. In the `always` block inside the module, the shifting logic is incorrect. The code assigns the same value from the `serial_in` to all positions in the `data` array, resulting in all bits being the same rather than shifting the bits sequentially.

This incorrect behavior is observed in the testbench when checking the output after each shift operation. The expected values are set to reflect a correct shifting operation, but the actual values show that the shifting is not functioning as intended. 

To fix this bug, the shifting logic in the `shift_register` module needs to be modified to correctly implement a serial-in parallel-out shift register. This involves properly propagating the bits through the `data` array when `shift_en` is asserted, such that each bit moves to the next position in the array.

After making this modification, run the testbench again to verify that the shifting operation now works as expected, and the error message no longer appears.
