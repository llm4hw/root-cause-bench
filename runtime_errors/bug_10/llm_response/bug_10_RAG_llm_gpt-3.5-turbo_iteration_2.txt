The error message "ERROR: Expected 0001 got 1111" is occurring because the test bench is comparing the `data` output in the shift register module with the wrong values. In the test bench, it checks for specific values (`4'b0001`, `4'b0010`, `4'b0101`, `4'b1011`) after setting the `serial_in` input accordingly, but the expected values are not aligned with the expected behavior of a shift register.

To fix this issue, you should modify your testbench to check the `data` output based on the correct expected behavior of a shift register. The values you are comparing against in the test bench do not align with the actual shifting behavior described in the shift register module.

To correct the test bench, you should check the `data` values after appropriate clock cycles and shifting operations. You can modify the comparison check to match the expected output after specific shifts occur in the shift register.

In summary, update the expected values in the test bench to reflect the correct behavior of a shift register. This will align the comparisons with the actual shifting operations in the module and resolve the error message you are seeing during simulation.

1. Consider the shift register from Figure 2. If you place = assignments inside of an always@(posedge
Clock) block to produce the shift register, you instead get the parallel registers shown in Figure 4
and Program 15.
You might also get one register, whose output is tied to B, C and D.
