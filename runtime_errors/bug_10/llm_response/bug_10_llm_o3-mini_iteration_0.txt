The underlying problem is that the design is using blocking assignments inside a clocked process. When you use blocking assignments in a sequential (clocked) block, each assignment is executed in order immediately, so the later assignments see the updated values from the earlier ones within the same clock edge. In this particular case, the intention is to perform a parallel update where all bits of the register are shifted simultaneously. However, because blocking assignments update the bits one after the other, each assignment “cascades” the new data through the register in a single cycle rather than mimicking a proper shift.

For example, when the serial input is 1 and the clock edge arrives, the first assignment updates the least significant bit with 1. Then the next assignment uses this already updated bit to update the next bit, and so on. As a result, the entire register ends up filled with ones (1111) instead of having a single one shifted into the register (expected 0001), which explains the error message.

To resolve this issue, you would need to change the way the assignments are made within the clocked process. The goal is to have all register bits compute their new value based on the previous state's bits simultaneously. This means that using non-blocking assignments is appropriate here. (I won’t provide a code fix, but the idea is to replace the "=" operators with the appropriate non-blocking assignment operator in a clocked process.)

In summary, the bug is occurring because blocking assignments cause sequential updates within the same clock edge, leading to all bits getting updated with the new value rather than implementing a proper shift register behavior. The solution is to use non-blocking assignments in the sequential logic so that all bits update concurrently based on the old register value.
