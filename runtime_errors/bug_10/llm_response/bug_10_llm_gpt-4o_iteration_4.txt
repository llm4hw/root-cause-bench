The error you've encountered is occurring because the logic within the shift register module is not correctly implementing a shift operation typically expected in such modules. Letâ€™s analyze why your testbench is reporting an error when it expected `0001` and got `1111`.

### Bug Analysis:
1. **Shift Register Behavior:**
   The shift register is intended to shift in a new bit at the least significant position (data[0]) and shift each existing bit to the next higher significant position (e.g., data[0] should move to data[1] and so forth). This does not happen correctly in the provided code.

2. **Current Implementation:**
   - When `shift_en` is asserted, the current implementation assigns `serial_in` to `data[0]` directly, which is correct. However, it also updates `data[1]` with `data[0]`, `data[2]` with `data[1]`, and `data[3]` with `data[2]` all combinatorially within the same clock edge. This kind of update does not correctly represent a shift register's behavior as all assignments happen concurrently within a non-blocking assignment context.

3. **Consequence:**
   - Since all updates occur at the same time effectively within the same clock cycle, this causes the entire register to file up with the previous value of `data[0]`, which was not yet updated in the real shift sense.

### Issue and Observation:
- When the clock edge triggers with `serial_in = 1`, `data[0]` correctly takes on `serial_in`, but because all lines are assigning concurrently, it causes a ripple effect where `data[1]`, `data[2]`, and `data[3]` all become equal to the original `data[0]`, hence leading to `1111` if `data[0]` was `1`.

### Root Cause:
- The concurrent assignments modify the register incorrectly because of the sequence and type of assignments used, which lead to a concurrent/cascade-like assignment instead of linear one-bit at-a-time shift.

### Explanation of Fix:
While discussing the fix steps explicitly, which you requested not to be directly included, the main issue would be addressed by making sure each stage of the shift register correctly contains the state from the previous stage from the prior clock cycle, which involves appropriate use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`). This way, each bit can receive its new value in a single clock cycle properly, with each position dependent on its immediate right position from the previous clock cycle.

This behavior aligns the shift operation with the expected progression of bits throughout consecutive shifts.
