In your code, specifically in the part where the data is shifted in the shift_en condition, there seems to be a mistake in how you are shifting the data. The issue is occurring because the assignments for shifting the data are incorrect, causing the outputs to be different from what you are expecting.

To fix this issue, in the shift_en condition, you need to correctly shift the data through the registers. You need to update the assignments as follows:

```verilog
data[3] = data[2];
data[2] = data[1];
data[1] = data[0];
data[0] = serial_in;
```

By updating the shift logic like this, the data will be shifted correctly through the registers, and you should get the expected output values during simulation.

Make this change in your shift_en condition and run the simulation again to verify that the error message no longer appears and the test cases pass successfully.

1. Consider the shift register from Figure 2. If you place = assignments inside of an always@(posedge
Clock) block to produce the shift register, you instead get the parallel registers shown in Figure 4
and Program 15.
You might also get one register, whose output is tied to B, C and D.
Both
possible outcomes are equivelent. These circuit make sense, but don‚Äôt create shift registers! (As...
