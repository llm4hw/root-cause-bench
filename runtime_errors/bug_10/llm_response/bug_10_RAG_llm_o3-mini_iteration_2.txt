The bug is that blocking assignments (using “=”) are used inside a clocked (sequential) always block rather than nonblocking assignments (“<=”). When blocking assignments are used, each assignment executes immediately in order during the same clock edge. This causes the new value of data[0] to be used in the assignment to data[1], and so on, so that by the end of the clock cycle, all bits are driven by the newly assigned value (in this case, all of them become 1). This behavior produces the output 1111 instead of the expected shifting register behavior (e.g., 0001).

To fix the issue, you need to change the assignments inside the always block from blocking (“=”) to nonblocking (“<=”). Nonblocking assignments ensure that all registers are updated concurrently based on the values at the beginning of the clock edge. Here’s the corrected section of code:

-------------------------------------------------
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        data <= 4'b0000; // Clear the register on reset
    end else if (shift_en) begin
        data[0] <= serial_in;
        data[1] <= data[0];
        data[2] <= data[1];
        data[3] <= data[2];
    end
end
-------------------------------------------------

By making this change, your shift register will now hold and shift data as expected, and the test bench error (“Expected 0001 got 1111”) will be resolved.
