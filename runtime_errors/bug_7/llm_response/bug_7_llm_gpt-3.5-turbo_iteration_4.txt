The bug in the provided code is in the testbench snippet where the expected states are being checked. The issue occurs because the `states` signal in the testbench is being compared incorrectly using the '!==', which is a strict inequality operator. This operator is not suitable for comparing multi-bit signals like states.

To fix this bug:
- Change the strict inequality operators '!== 2'bXX' in the testbench to '!=' because '!== 2'bXX' is not a valid syntax and is not comparing the states correctly. 
Doing this will fix the comparison and allow the expected values to be checked correctly against the states signal.

After applying this fix, re-run the simulation to ensure that the expected states are now being properly compared, and make sure the test cases execute correctly.
