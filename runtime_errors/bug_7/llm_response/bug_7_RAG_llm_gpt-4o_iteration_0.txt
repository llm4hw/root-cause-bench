The error message "ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got 11" indicates that the testbench is expecting the state to be `Red` (encoded as `00`) after the reset and initial state progression, but it is getting `11`, which corresponds to the state `Ped`.

Upon examining the main module's code, we notice that the state transitions are not aligning with what the testbench expects. Let's breakdown the state transitions in the module:

1. Initial State: If `resetn` is not asserted, the state is set to `Red`.
2. State transitions from:
   - `Red` to `Ped`
   - `Ped` to `Red`
   - `Green` to `Yellow`
   - `Yellow` to `Red`

Now, let's see what the testbench expects:
- State sequence: `Red` -> `Ped` -> `Green` -> `Yellow` -> `Red`

The main source of the error is in the state transition logic of the main module. The desired sequence expects a transition from `Ped` to `Green`, but the given code transitions from `Ped` to `Red`, which causes the testbench to fail when checking for `Green`.

To fix this, you need to modify the `always@(state)` block in the main module to correctly follow the expected state sequence:
```verilog
    always@(state) begin
        case (state)
            Red: next = Ped;
            Ped: next = Green; // Change from Red to Green
            Green: next = Yellow;
            Yellow: next = Red;
            default: next = 2'bxx;
        endcase
    end
```

With this change, the state machine will now correctly transition from `Ped` to `Green`, which aligns with the testbench's expected sequence, resolving the error.
