The bug in the provided code is in the way the test bench is checking the `states` for each expected value. The issue is that the test bench code uses the non-blocking assignment operator `!==` in the if statements to check the `states`. The `!==` is a combination of the negation `!` and the equality `==` operators. This causes the test bench to check if `states` is not equal to the expected value, which is not the intended way to compare.

To fix this issue, you should change all instances of `!==` to `!=` in the if statements inside the initial block of the test bench code. This will allow the test bench to correctly compare the values of `states` with the expected values and determine if the test cases pass or fail accurately.

Here is an updated version of the test bench code with the corrections:
```verilog
// State sequence: Red -> Ped -> Green -> Yellow -> Red
#10;
if (states != 2'b00) begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states != 2'b11) begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Ped (11), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states != 2'b01) begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states != 2'b10) begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Yellow (10), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states != 2'b00) begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end
```

By making this change, the test bench will correctly compare the values of `states` and the expected values, which should resolve the error message and allow the test cases to pass as intended.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
