The bug in the testbench code is due to using the non-blocking assignment operator `!==` instead of the equality operator `==` in the if statements checking the states. This incorrect usage of `!==` in the testbench code is causing the simulation to generate the error message "ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got 11".

To fix this issue, you need to replace all instances of `!==` with `==` in the if statements in the testbench code. By correcting the comparison operators in the if statements, the testbench will accurately check the states against the expected values and the error should be resolved. 

Here is an example of the corrected if statement for checking the expected states:
```verilog
if (states == 2'b00) begin
    $display("Expected Red (00), got Red (00)");
end
```

Make sure to apply this fix to all if statements in the testbench code that compare the states to the expected values.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
