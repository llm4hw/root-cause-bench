The issue you are encountering during the simulation stems from a discrepancy between the expected state transition sequence in your testbench and the state transition logic defined in your Verilog module, `top_module`.

In your Verilog module, you have defined the following state transitions:

1. Red (00) transitions to Ped (11)
2. Ped (11) transitions to Red (00)
3. Green (01) transitions to Yellow (10)
4. Yellow (10) transitions to Red (00)

However, according to your testbench, the expected sequence of states is: Red (00) -> Ped (11) -> Green (01) -> Yellow (10) -> Red (00).

The problem here is that there is no transition to `Green (01)` from `Ped (11)` in your state transition logic. Instead, `Ped (11)` transitions back to `Red (00)`, which directly conflicts with the testbench expectation where the next state should be `Green (01)`.

This discrepancy is leading to the observed error, as the actual state transitions in the module do not match the sequence expected by the testbench.

To resolve this issue, you need to align the state transition logic in your Verilog module with the expected state sequence of the testbench:

- You would need to modify the module's logic to include a transition from `Ped (11)` to `Green (01)` if that is the intended sequence.
  
By doing so, you can ensure the module's behavior is consistent with the testbench's requirements, eliminating the mismatch and subsequent errors during simulation.
