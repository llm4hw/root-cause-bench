The error message "ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got 11" suggests that, at some point in the simulation, the state was expected to be Red (binary 00), but instead, the state was Ped (binary 11). According to the provided code, this discrepancy arises because the definition of state transitions in the `top_module` differs from the expected behavior expressed in the testbench.

Upon examining the `top_module`:

1. Initial state when reset is not active: The top module initializes the state to `Red` (00) when `resetn` is de-asserted.

2. State transitions:
   - From `Red`, it goes to `Ped`.
   - From `Ped`, it goes back to `Red`.
   - From `Green`, it correctly goes to `Yellow`.
   - From `Yellow`, it goes to `Red`.
  
In contrast, looking at the testbench:
- It asserts expectations that transition from `Red` to `Ped`, `Ped` to `Green`, `Green` to `Yellow`, then `Yellow` to `Red`.

Root Cause:
- The implementation of the state transitions in the `top_module` does not include a path from `Ped` to `Green`, leading to the discrepancy in the testbench's expectation. Consequently, the testbench is incorrect in expecting a `Green` state after `Ped`.

Solution:
- Fix the state transition logic in `top_module` to reflect the desired sequence as per the testbench's expectations. Specifically, modify the transition from `Ped` to `Green`.

Here is the corrected `top_module`:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input resetn,
    output [1:0] states
);
parameter Red=0, Green=1, Yellow=2, Ped=3;
    reg [1:0] state, next;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (~resetn) 
            state <= Red;
        else 
            state <= next;
    end

    always @(state) begin
        case (state)
            Red: next = Ped;
            Ped: next = Green; // Change transition to Green
            Green: next = Yellow;
            Yellow: next = Red;
            default: next = 2'bxx;
        endcase
    end

    assign states = state;
endmodule
```

With this correction, the state transition matches what is expected in the testbench, and the test bench should pass without errors.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
