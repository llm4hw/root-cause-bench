The bug in the code is due to an incorrect state transition in the finite state machine (FSM). Specifically, the `Ped` state transitions back to `Red` instead of progressing to `Green`, causing the FSM to cycle between `Red` and `Ped` and never reach the `Green` or `Yellow` states. This results in the test bench error when it expects `Green` after `Ped`.

**Why it occurs:**
- In the combinational `always` block, the `Ped` state sets `next = Red`. This creates a loop between `Red` and `Ped`.
- The test bench expects the sequence `Red → Ped → Green → Yellow → Red` but the FSM transitions `Red → Ped → Red` instead.

**Fix:**
Modify the state transition logic for the `Ped` state to point to `Green` instead of `Red`:

```verilog
always@(state) begin
    case (state)
        Red: next = Ped;
        Ped: next = Green; // Fix: Transition to Green instead of Red
        Green: next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        default: next = 2'bxx;
    endcase
end
```

**Explanation:**
- By correcting the `Ped` state's transition to `Green`, the FSM follows the intended sequence: `Red → Ped → Green → Yellow → Red`.
- This aligns the design with the test bench's expected behavior, resolving the error where the state incorrectly cycled between `Red` and `Ped`.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
