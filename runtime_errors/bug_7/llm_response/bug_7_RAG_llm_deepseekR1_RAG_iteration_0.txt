The bug is in the state transition logic of the Verilog module. Specifically, when the current state is `Ped`, the next state is incorrectly set to `Red` instead of `Green`. This prevents the state machine from progressing through the expected sequence of `Red → Ped → Green → Yellow → Red`.

**Why it occurs:**
- The state machine's `case` statement for `STATE_3` (Ped) assigns `NextState = STATE_Initial` (Red), creating a loop between `Red` and `Ped`.
- As a result, after the first clock edge post-reset, the state transitions to `Ped` and then back to `Red`, never reaching `Green` or `Yellow`. The testbench detects this mismatch when it checks for `Red` but finds `Ped`.

**Fix:**
Modify the transition for the `Ped` state to move to `Green` instead of `Red`:

```verilog
always@(state) begin
    case (state)
        Red:    next = Ped;
        Ped:    next = Green;  // Corrected line (previously "next = Red")
        Green:  next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        default: next = 2'bxx;
    endcase
end
```

**Explanation:**
- With this fix, the state sequence becomes `Red → Ped → Green → Yellow → Red`, aligning with the testbench's expectations.
- The testbench's timing assumes a new state is entered every 10ns (after each clock edge). After correcting the transitions, the states will update as intended, and the testbench checks will pass.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
