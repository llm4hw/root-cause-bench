The issue in the testbench code is due to the use of the "!==", which is for a "not equal" comparison. In the testbench, the code is using "!== 2'b00" for the first comparison which is incorrect because it is checking if the states are not equal to 2'b00. Hence, the error message "ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got 11" is displayed.

To fix this issue, you should replace "!== 2'b00" with "=== 2'b00" in all the if statements in the testbench code. By changing this comparison to "===", you are checking if the states are equal to the expected values instead of checking for inequality.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

the design are shown in Example 4.8. Design a
Verilog test bench to exhaustively verify this
design under all input conditions. Your test
bench should use two nested for loops within
a procedural block to generate all of the stimu-
lus patterns automatically. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 30 ns
in order to give sufÔ¨Åcient time for the signals to
ripple through the adder.

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
