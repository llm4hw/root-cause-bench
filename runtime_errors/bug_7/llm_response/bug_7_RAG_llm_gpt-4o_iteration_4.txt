The issue here stems from the mismatch between the expected state transitions in the test bench and the actual state transitions as defined in the `top_module` code. Let's analyze the root cause:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Initial State Setup:**
   - Upon reset (`resetn` low), the module sets the initial state to `Red` (`00`).
   
2. **State Transitions in the `top_module`:**
   - `Red` transitions to `Ped`.
   - `Ped` transitions to `Red`.
   - `Green` transitions to `Yellow`.
   - `Yellow` transitions to `Red`.

3. **Testbench Expectations:**
   - The test bench expects the state sequence to be: `Red` (`00`) -> `Ped` (`11`) -> `Green` (`01`) -> `Yellow` (`10`) -> `Red` (`00`).
   - However, the code transitions directly from `Red` to `Ped` and from `Ped` back to `Red`, without transitioning to `Green` and `Yellow` unless externally forced.

### Root Cause
- The state machine defined in `top_module` simply toggles between the `Red` and `Ped` states when the simulation runs, as there's no transition defined from `Ped` to `Green`, nor from `Red` to `Green`.

### Solution
To fix this, you need to implement the missing transitions to match the sequence anticipated by the testbench:

1. **Modify the State Transitions:**
   - Add a transition from either `Ped` to `Green` or `Red` to `Green` if it follows the logical flow of your intended design.

2. **Updated Code with Modified Transitions:**
   - Revise the case statement inside `top_module`:

```verilog
always @(state) begin
	case (state)
		Red: next = Ped;
		Ped: next = Green; // Changed from transitioning back to Red
		Green: next = Yellow;
		Yellow: next = Red;
		default: next = 2'bxx;
	endcase
end
```

This modification ensures that, once the state transitions to `Ped`, the next transition will be to `Green`, aligning with the expected sequence in the test bench.
