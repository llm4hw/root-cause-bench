The problem isn’t with the test bench but with the state‐machine’s transition logic. The test bench is checking for the state sequence Red → Ped → Green → Yellow → Red, but the state-machine’s case statement does not follow that order. In the state transition block, when the current state is Ped the next state is set to Red instead of Green. As a result, when the simulation reaches the point where the test bench expects Ped (or later a different state), the output remains 11 (Ped) rather than progressing to the expected state, causing the error message.

In short, the bug is occurring because the transition for the Ped state is defined incorrectly in the code—a wrong next state is assigned. This discrepancy between the intended state transitions (as assumed by the test bench) and the actual ones is what causes the test bench to detect that at a clock edge the signal value does not match the expected value.
