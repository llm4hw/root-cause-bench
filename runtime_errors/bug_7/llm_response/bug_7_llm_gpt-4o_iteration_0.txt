The error you're encountering is related to the sequence of state transitions in your design. Specifically, the test bench expects the states to transition in a specific sequence: Red -> Ped -> Green -> Yellow -> Red. However, the actual sequence implemented in the `top_module` does not match the expected sequence from the test bench.

Here's what's happening step-by-step:

1. **Reset Condition**: On reset (when `resetn` is 0), the state is correctly initialized to `Red` (00).

2. **State Transition Logic**: When not in the reset state, your state machine transitions are defined in the `always @(state)` block. The case statement transitions are:
   - `Red` to `Ped`
   - `Ped` to `Red`
   - `Green` to `Yellow`
   - `Yellow` to `Red`

3. **Test Bench Sequence**: The test bench expects the sequence to follow:
   - Start from `Red` (00)
   - Transition to `Ped` (which is incorrectly mapped to 11 in the test bench)
   - Transition to `Green` (01)
   - Transition to `Yellow` (10)
   - Then return to `Red` (00)

4. **Discrepancy**: The error indicates an expectation for the `Ped` state to be `11`, but the implemented state sequence doesn't include a transition to a state value of `11`. Instead, your Verilog code first transitions from `Red` to `Ped`, which in your case means incorrectly assumed as `11` as per expectations but the design does not go to Green state.

5. **Root Cause**: The mismatch comes from the interpretative expectation that `Ped` in the system means a specific state which is `11`, and this isn't in sequence or part of the transition logic currently implemented. There is no mapping for state `Ped` in the test bench to Green or Ped should be defined as 11. 

To correct this, any one step needs the following:
- Ensure that the states are correctly defined and corresponding to the sequence assumed by the test bench. Either update the `state` variables to fit the `testbench` logic or verify the expected sequence in the `testbench` aligns with the implemented logic. Likely your state for `Ped` is mismatched and not corresponding to `11` in the expectations. The state 'Green' is not reached which causes the sequence deviation.

In essence, the error arises because the test bench's expected sequence doesn't match the state transition logic in the `top_module`. Ensure you systematically address this by synchronizing both descriptions of your traffic light system (both logical design in Verilog and the expectations in your test).
