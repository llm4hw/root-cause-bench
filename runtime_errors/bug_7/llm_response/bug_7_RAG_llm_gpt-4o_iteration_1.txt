The bug in the code is occurring because there is a mismatch between the expected state transitions defined in the code and the test bench. The test bench is expecting the states to transition from Red (00) to Ped (11) directly, but according to the given module's state transition logic, the state Red (00) actually transitions to Ped (implicitly assumed 11) correctly, but the Ped state is not defined as 11 in the module.

The reason for the error is that the parameter assignments in the module are incorrect for what the test bench expects. Here's a breakdown of the error:

- In the code, `parameter Red=0` is correctly interpreted as `2'b00`.
- However, `Ped=3` is intended to map to `2'b11` for state transitions, which does not occur because of the mismatch.

Fix:
To match the expected state values in the test bench, you should adjust the `Ped` parameter in the module to correctly align with the states expected by the testbench. 

```verilog
parameter Red=2'b00, Green=2'b01, Yellow=2'b10, Ped=2'b11;
```

This parameter assignment ensures that your state logic and the expected testbench outputs align correctly, hence eliminating the error.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
