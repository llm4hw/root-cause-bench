The problem is not a synthesis or compilation error but a mismatch between what the finite‐state machine in the design does and what the testbench expects. In the design, the state transitions are defined so that when the state is Red, the “next” value is immediately set to Ped. Because the state register updates at the next clock edge, once you release reset the first clock edge moves the state from Red to Ped. However, the testbench was written to expect the module’s state to remain Red for one cycle after reset deassertion and then go to Ped on the following cycle. In other words, the implemented state transition sequence (Red → Ped → Red → …) does not match the expected sequence (Red → Ped → Green → Yellow → Red).

This error occurs because the combinational process computes “next” from the current state immediately and, as a result, the very next positive clock edge updates the state from Red to Ped. The testbench then checks for Red at a time when the design has already advanced to Ped, triggering the error message “Expected Red (00), but got 11.”

Thus, the root cause is that the finite state machine’s state transition logic does not align with the testbench expectations.
