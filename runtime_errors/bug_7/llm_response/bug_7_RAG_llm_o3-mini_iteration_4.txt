The problem turns out not to be a tool or simulation scheduling issue but a logic error in your state machine. The test bench expects the state sequence to be:

 • Red (00) → Ped (11) → Green (01) → Yellow (10) → Red (00)

However, your design’s combinational logic for the state transitions is written as follows:

  Red: next = Ped;  
  Ped: next = Red;  
  Green: next = Yellow;  
  Yellow: next = Red;

Notice that when the design is in the Ped state (11), you assign next = Red (00). This is not what the test bench expects—the test bench expects that after Ped, the state will be Green (01). In your simulation, after reset the first posedge makes state = Red. At the next posedge, the combinational block (which continuously computes “next” as soon as “state” changes) has already set next = Ped (because Red → Ped). In the following cycle, the state gets updated to Ped. Later, when you check for a state of Red, you find Ped (11) instead. Hence, you get the error:

 ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got 11

To fix this bug, change the transition for the Ped state so that it goes to Green (01) as expected. Modify your always block as follows:

  Red: next = Ped;  
  Ped: next = Green; // Fixed: transition from Ped to Green  
  Green: next = Yellow;  
  Yellow: next = Red;

With this change, the state transitions become:

 1. On reset, state = Red (00)  
 2. Next cycle: state transitions to Ped (11)  
 3. Next cycle: state transitions to Green (01)  
 4. Next cycle: state transitions to Yellow (10)  
 5. Finally, back to Red (00)

This matches the sequence expected by your test bench and eliminates the simulation error.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
