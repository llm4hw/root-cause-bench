The bug in the code is in the test bench's comparison of the `states` signal. The test bench checks the `states` signal against the expected values using the `!==` operator, which is a non-blocking comparison operator. This operator is not suitable for comparing the values of `states` immediately after assigning a new value, as the value of `states` may not have been updated yet.

To fix this issue, you should change the comparison operators in the test bench from `!==` to `!=`. The `!=` operator is a blocking comparison operator, which ensures that the comparison is made after the assignment of the new value to `states`. By using the blocking operator, you will compare the `states` signal effectively with the expected values once the values have been updated correctly.

Here's an example of how you can modify the comparisons in the test bench:
Change:
```verilog
if (states !== 2'b00)
```
to:
```verilog
if (states != 2'b00)
```
Repeat this modification for all the comparison statements in the test bench. After making these changes, run the simulation again to verify that the test cases pass without the "Expected Red (00), but got 11" error.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

bench should use two nested for loops within

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
