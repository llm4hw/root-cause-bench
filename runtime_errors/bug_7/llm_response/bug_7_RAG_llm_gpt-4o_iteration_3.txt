The error message "ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got 11" is occurring because the test bench is expecting the state sequence to be Red -> Ped -> Green -> Yellow -> Red, while the actual code logic transitions from Red to Ped and then directly back to Red, skipping the Green and Yellow states entirely.

The root cause of the problem lies in the state transition logic in the `top_module` Verilog module. The module's current state machine only defines transitions from Red to Ped, and from Ped back to Red. There are no transitions defined for the Green and Yellow states, and thus they are never reached. Moreover, the code initializes the state to (`Red`, i.e., 00) correctly when `resetn` is low but does not follow the sequence expected by the testbench after that due to the missing transitions.

To fix this issue, you need to adjust the state transition logic in the `always @(state)` block. Specifically, you should define transitions from Ped to Green and from Green to Yellow to follow the sequence expected by the testbench. Here is how you can modify the state transition logic:

```verilog
always@(state) begin
    case (state)
        Red: next = Ped;
        Ped: next = Green;  // Transition from Ped to Green
        Green: next = Yellow; // Transition from Green to Yellow
        Yellow: next = Red;
        default: next = 2'bxx;
    endcase
end
```

With these changes, the state machine now includes transitions from Ped to Green and from Green to Yellow, which should align the module's behavior with the expectations of the testbench, resolving the "Expected Red (00), but got 11" error.
