The bug in the code is likely caused by the fact that the `states` signal is being compared using the "!==", which is a non-blocking assignment operator. This means that the values of `states` are being checked at the same time they are being updated, which can lead to incorrect comparisons. 

To fix this issue, you can change the comparison operators from "!==" to "==", to effectively compare the updated values of `states`. By making this change, the comparisons will reflect the correct values of `states` after the assignment has taken place. 

Here is how you can modify the comparison statements in the initial block of the testbench:

```verilog
#10;
if (states == 2'b00) begin
    $display("Expected Red (00) and got Red (00)");
end else begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states == 2'b11) begin
    $display("Expected Ped (11) and got Ped (11)");
end else begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Ped (11), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states == 2'b01) begin
    $display("Expected Green (01) and got Green (01)");
end else begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states == 2'b10) begin
    $display("Expected Yellow (10) and got Yellow (10)");
end else begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Yellow (10), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (states == 2'b00) begin
    $display("Expected Red (00) and got Red (00)");
end else begin
    $display("ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got %b", states);
    $fatal;
end
```

By changing the comparison operators to "==", it should resolve the issue with the expected and received values in the test bench.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
