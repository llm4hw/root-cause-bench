The bug is in the state transition logic where the `Ped` state incorrectly transitions back to `Red` instead of moving to `Green`. This causes the state machine to cycle between `Red` and `Ped`, failing to reach `Green` and subsequent states as expected by the testbench.

**Why it occurs:**
- In the combinational `always` block, the `Ped` case assigns `next = Red`. According to the testbench's intended sequence, after `Ped`, the state should transition to `Green`.
- This error results in the state machine being stuck in a loop between `Red` and `Ped`, leading to the testbench detecting an unexpected state (`11` instead of `00` at the first check after reset).

**Fix:**
Modify the `Ped` case to transition to `Green` instead of `Red`:
```verilog
case (state)
  Red: next = Ped;
  Ped: next = Green;  // Corrected line (was: Ped: next = Red)
  Green: next = Yellow;
  Yellow: next = Red;
  default: next = 2'bxx;
endcase
```

**Explanation:**
- After correcting the `Ped` transition, the state sequence becomes `Red ‚Üí Ped ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red`, aligning with the testbench's expectations.
- This ensures the state machine progresses through all intended states, resolving the error.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
