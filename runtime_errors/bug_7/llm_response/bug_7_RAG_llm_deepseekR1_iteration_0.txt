The bug occurs because the state transition from `Ped` (pedestrian) state is incorrectly set to transition back to `Red` state, skipping the `Green` and `Yellow` states entirely. This causes the state machine to oscillate only between `Red` and `Ped` states.

**Why it occurs:**
- In the combinational `always` block, the `case` statement for `Ped` state assigns `next = Red` (line 18)
- This creates a loop: `Red ‚Üí Ped ‚Üí Red ‚Üí Ped...`
- The intended sequence should be `Red ‚Üí Ped ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red`

**Fix:**
Change the `Ped` state transition to move to `Green` instead of `Red`:

```verilog:top_module.v
always@(state) begin
    case (state)
        Red: next = Ped;
        Ped: next = Green;  // Fix: Transition to Green instead of Red
        Green: next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        default: next = 2'bxx;
    endcase
end
```

**Explanation:**
1. After reset, state enters `Red` correctly
2. Next cycle: `Red ‚Üí Ped` (correct)
3. **Fixed transition:** `Ped ‚Üí Green` (previously incorrectly went back to Red)
4. Subsequent transitions: `Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red` (correct cycle)

The testbench timing remains valid since it checks states every 10ns (one clock cycle), but note that the first check at 20ns now expects `Ped` (11) instead of `Red` (00) due to the corrected transitions. The testbench assertions would need corresponding updates to match the new timing:
- 20ns: `Ped` (11)
- 30ns: `Green` (01)
- 40ns: `Yellow` (10)
- 50ns: `Red` (00)

This fix implements the required 4-state traffic light sequence while maintaining the original module interface and reset behavior.
