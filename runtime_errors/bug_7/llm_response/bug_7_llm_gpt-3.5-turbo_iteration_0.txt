The bug in this code is that the test bench is checking the value of `states` using the inequality operator `!==` instead of the equality operator `===`. This is causing the error messages to be generated even when the expected states are correct. 

Additionally, the reason why this bug is occurring is due to the incorrect usage of the inequality operator, which is checking for a value other than the expected one for each state instead of checking for the exact expected value.

To fix this bug, the test bench code should be updated to use the equality operator `===` when comparing the value of `states` with the expected state values. This change will correctly compare the binary representation of `states` with the expected values and avoid generating false error messages during simulation.
