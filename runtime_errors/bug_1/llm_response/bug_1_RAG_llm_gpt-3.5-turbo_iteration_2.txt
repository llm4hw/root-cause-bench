The bug in the test bench code is in the assignment statements for the test cases. In Verilog, when you assign values to multiple bits, you should use curly brackets { } around the values to combine them correctly. However, in the test bench code, the assignments are using commas instead of curly brackets. 

To fix this issue, you should modify the assignment statements in the initial block as follows:
1. Change `{p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f} = 6'b111000;` to `{p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f} = 6'b{1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0};`
2. Change `{p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f} = 6'b000111;` to `{p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f} = 6'b{0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1};`
3. Change `{p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f} = 6'b101101;` to `{p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f} = 6'b{1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1};`

By making these changes, the test bench will correctly assign the input values to the signals, and the comparison with the expected output value will work as intended.
