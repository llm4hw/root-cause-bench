The error is occurring due to a misunderstanding of the behavior of the bitwise AND operator used in the assignment for `p1y` in the `top_module`. In your code, you have:

```verilog
assign p1y = {p1a, p1b, p1c} & {p1d, p1e, p1f};
```

This expression performs a bitwise AND operation between two vectors: `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` and `{p1d, p1e, p1f}`. This operation will result in a 3-bit vector, not a single bit. For `p1y` to be 1, all bits in the resulting 3-bit vector need to be 1. However, the test cases are checking for conditions where entire sets of bits are 1 on one side or the other, but not simultaneously for both sets.

**Solution:**

To fix this, you need to understand what your intended logic is for `p1y`. If your intention is for `p1y` to be 1 if and only if both `p1a, p1b, p1c` are all 1 and `p1d, p1e, p1f` are also all 1, then you can change the assignment to use logical AND reductions:

```verilog
assign p1y = (p1a & p1b & p1c) & (p1d & p1e & p1f);
```

This ensures `p1y` is 1 only when all inputs are 1 on both sides, aligning with what you seem to expect in your test cases. However, given your test cases, it seems there is also a misunderstanding, as with this fix none of your test cases will output `1`. If your expectation for when `p1y` becomes `1` should be altered, you would need to adjust the logic further.
