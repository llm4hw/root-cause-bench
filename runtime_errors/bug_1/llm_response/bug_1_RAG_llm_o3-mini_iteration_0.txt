The bug is that the assignment for p1y is using a bitwise AND on two 3‐bit vectors rather than reducing each group to a single Boolean value. In the code

  assign p1y = {p1a, p1b, p1c} & {p1d, p1e, p1f};

the operator & is applied between two 3‐bit concatenated signals, so the result is a 3‐bit vector computed bit‐by‐bit. When that 3‐bit result is assigned to the 1‑bit output p1y, only the least significant bit is used. For example, in Test Case 1 the inputs are

  {p1a, p1b, p1c} = 3’b111  
  {p1d, p1e, p1f} = 3’b000  

so the bitwise AND produces 3’b000 and p1y becomes 0, even though the intended output should be 1 (because the designer expected that if all bits in one of the groups are 1 then p1y should be 1).

The fix is to use reduction operators (and/or logical operators) to reduce each group to a single bit and then combine those results appropriately. For example, if the intended behavior is that p1y should be 1 when either

  all of p1a, p1b, p1c are 1
  or all of p1d, p1e, p1f are 1,

then p1y can be defined as follows:

  assign p1y = (&{p1a, p1b, p1c}) || (&{p1d, p1e, p1f});

Here, the reduction AND operator (&) applied on each concatenated vector produces a 1 if and only if every bit is 1, and the logical OR (||) then makes p1y equal to 1 if at least one of the groups meets the condition. This change ensures that p1y is a single-bit signal with the expected value, and the test bench will then pass Test Case 1 and others.
