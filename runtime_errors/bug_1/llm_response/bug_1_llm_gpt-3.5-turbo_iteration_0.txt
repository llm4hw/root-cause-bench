The bug in the code is occurring due to the usage of the bitwise AND operator '&' in the assignment of p1y and p2y in the top_module module. The intended behavior seems to be concatenating the inputs and then performing a bitwise AND operation, but the current implementation is not achieving that.

In Verilog, the '&' operator is used for performing bitwise AND operations, not concatenation. So when the concatenation operation '{p1a, p1b, p1c}' and '{p1d, p1e, p1f}' is being combined with '&', it's actually performing the bitwise AND operation on each bit of the concatenated values individually, which is leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the concatenation operation should be performed first on the input signals and then the bitwise AND operation should be applied. You can use the '{}' concatenation operator to concatenate the signals and then apply the '&' operator to perform the bitwise AND operation. 

Make this modification in the assignment of p1y and p2y in the top_module module, and the issue should be resolved.
