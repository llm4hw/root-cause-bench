The problem is caused by using the bitwise AND operator between two concatenated multi‐bit signals when the intent was to conditionally check whether one of the groups of three bits is entirely 1. In your module you concatenate three 1‑bit inputs into a 3‑bit vector for each group and then perform a bitwise AND. This operation applies the AND to each corresponding bit of the two 3‑bit vectors, resulting in another 3‑bit vector. Since your output is declared as a 1‑bit signal, only one bit (typically the least significant bit) of that 3‑bit result is used. For example, in Test Case 1 the first group is “111” and the second group is “000” so the bitwise AND yields “000,” and the assigned bit (0) fails the test bench’s expectation.

In essence, the bug occurs because the code is using element‐wise bitwise operators on multi‑bit vectors instead of reducing each group to a single condition (such as “all ones”) before combining the results. The fix is to change the operation so that each group of inputs is reduced to a single bit that represents whether all its bits are 1, and then combine those single bits appropriately.
