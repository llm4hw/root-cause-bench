The bug in the code is with the way the values are assigned to the signals in the test bench. In Verilog, you cannot assign values to a group of bits like that directly. You should assign them individually. 

Instead of assigning values like {p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f} = 6'b111000, you should assign them one by one: p1a = 1; p1b = 1; p1c = 1; p1d = 0; p1e = 0; p1f = 0; for Test Case 1.

So, the correct way to fix this is to change the assignment of values in each test case in the testbench code from assigning as a group to assigning individually to each signal. By doing this, you will accurately control the values of each input signal for the testbench and avoid the discrepancy that is causing the test case failures.
