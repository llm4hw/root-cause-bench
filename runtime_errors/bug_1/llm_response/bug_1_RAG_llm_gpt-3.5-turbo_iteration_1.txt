The bug in the code is in the test case comparison statements. The "!== 1" and "!== 0" should be "== 1" and "== 0" respectively for correct comparison of the expected values. 

Here is the corrected part of the test bench code for Test Case 1 as an example:
``` 
        if (p1y != 1) begin
            $display("ERROR: Test Case 1 failed. p1y = %b (Expected: 1)", p1y);
            $fatal;
        }
```

You will need to make the same adjustment to the comparison operators in Test Case 2 and Test Case 3 as well.
