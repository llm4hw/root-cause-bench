The problem is that the logic in the module is using a bitwise AND on two multi‐bit vectors, so it does not implement the intended condition. In the failing test case, only the first three inputs (p1a, p1b, p1c) are 1 while the other three (p1d, p1e, p1f) are 0. The code concatenates these into two three‐bit vectors and then bitwise ANDs them. Even though one three‐bit vector is 111, the other is 000, so bitwise AND results in 000 which, when assigned to a one‐bit output, becomes 0.

This bug is occurring because the operator “&” in the expression is acting on each bit of the concatenated groups rather than producing a single true/false result based on a condition (for example, “if the first group is all ones then…”). In effect, the two groups are combined incorrectly, so that even if one group satisfies the condition, the other group forces the overall result to zero when it does not.

The intended design likely needed a check (often using reduction operators or combining comparisons) to verify that one of the groups is all ones rather than performing a bitwise AND between the groups. By misusing the concatenation and bitwise operators, the resulting logic does not match the expected behavior from the test bench.
