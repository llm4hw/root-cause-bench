The bug in the code is in the assignment statement for `p1y` in the `top_module`. The concatenation operation `{p1a, p1b, p1c} & {p1d, p1e, p1f}` is using the bitwise AND operator `&` which performs a bitwise AND operation on each corresponding bit of the operands. This might not be the intended operation as it seems like the goal is to concatenate the bits.

To fix this bug, you should replace the `&` operator with `,` in the assignment statement for `p1y` in the `top_module`. This will perform a concatenation operation rather than a bitwise AND operation. 

After making this change, rerun the simulation and test the test cases to ensure that the expected behavior is achieved.
