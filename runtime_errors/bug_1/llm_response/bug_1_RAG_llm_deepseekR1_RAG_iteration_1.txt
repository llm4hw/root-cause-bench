The error occurs because the DUT's logic for `p1y` is incorrectly implemented. The current code uses a bitwise AND between two 3-bit groups, but the intended functionality requires **OR-ing the results of two independent AND operations** (one for each group of inputs).

### Root Cause:
- **Incorrect Logic for `p1y`:**  
  The original code for `p1y` is:
  ```verilog
  assign p1y = {p1a, p1b, p1c} & {p1d, p1e, p1f};
  ```
  This performs a **bitwise AND** between two 3-bit vectors (e.g., `3'b111 & 3'b000 = 3'b000`), then truncates the result to 1 bit (LSB = 0).  
  However, the test cases expect `p1y` to be **1 if either group of inputs (p1a-p1c or p1d-p1f) is all 1s**. This requires **OR-ing** the reduction ANDs of each group.

### Fix:
Modify the DUT's code to compute the **OR of two AND operations**:
```verilog
assign p1y = (&{p1a, p1b, p1c}) | (&{p1d, p1e, p1f});
```
This ensures `p1y` is 1 if **either** `p1a, p1b, p1c` **all** are 1 **OR** `p1d, p1e, p1f` **all** are 1.

### Why This Works:
- **Test Case 1:** `{p1a, p1b, p1c} = 3'b111` (AND = 1), `{p1d, p1e, p1f} = 3'b000` (AND = 0).  
  `1 | 0 = 1` ‚Üí Matches the expected value.
- **Test Case 2:** `{p1d, p1e, p1f} = 3'b111` (AND = 1) ‚Üí `1 | 1 = 1`.
- **Test Case 3:** Both groups have mixed values (ANDs = 0) ‚Üí `0 | 0 = 0`.

### Additional Issue in `p2y`:
The code for `p2y` also has a similar bug. It should **AND the reduction ANDs** of both groups:
```verilog
assign p2y = (&{p2a, p2b}) & (&{p2c, p2d});
```
This ensures `p2y` is 1 **only if** all four inputs (`p2a-p2d`) are 1.

### Updated DUT Code:
```verilog
module top_module(
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f,
    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output p2y
);
    assign p1y = (&{p1a, p1b, p1c}) | (&{p1d, p1e, p1f}); // OR of two ANDs
    assign p2y = (&{p2a, p2b}) & (&{p2c, p2d});          // AND of two ANDs
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **`p1y` Fix:** Switched to `|` (OR) to match the test case's expectation that either group of 1s triggers `p1y = 1`.
- **`p2y` Fix:** Ensures all four inputs must be 1 for `p2y = 1`, as intended for an AND-of-ANDs structure.
