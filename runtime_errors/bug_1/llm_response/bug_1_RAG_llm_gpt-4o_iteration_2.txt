The root of the issue is the way you are using the bitwise AND operator `&` for the assignments to `p1y` and `p2y` in the `top_module`. In Verilog, the bitwise AND operator `&` operates bit by bit on the operands, which means it computes a bitwise AND for each pair of corresponding bits in the two operands.

For the specific line causing the issue:

```verilog
assign p1y =  {p1a, p1b, p1c}  & {p1d, p1e, p1f};
```

This line is performing a bitwise AND operation on each corresponding bit pair of the two 3-bit vectors `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` and `{p1d, p1e, p1f}`. Thus, `p1y` will be a 3-bit result rather than a single bit. Consequently, expecting a single-bit evaluation for `p1y` in your test cases is incorrect.

For the expected logic in your testbench, where `p1y` should go high if all bits in `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` or all bits in `{p1d, p1e, p1f}` are ones, here is the correct approach:

If you want `p1y` to be 1 when all bits of either top or bottom three bits are ones, you should change the logic to:

```verilog
assign p1y = (p1a & p1b & p1c) | (p1d & p1e & p1f);
```

Similarly, the assignment for `p2y` should be:

```verilog
assign p2y = (p2a & p2b) & (p2c & p2d);
```

This uses logical AND `&` reduction on each group of bits individually and then combines the results using logical OR as per required logic in the test cases. Update your `assign` statements in your Verilog code accordingly to fix the issue.
