The problem is that the assignment of p1y is using a bitwise AND between two multi‐bit concatenations, which produces a multi‐bit result that is then inadvertently truncated to a single bit. In your design, comparing the expected outcome from the test bench, you intended for p1y to be 1 when one of the groups (either {p1a, p1b, p1c} or {p1d, p1e, p1f}) is all ones. However, the current expression performs a pair‐by‐pair bitwise AND of the bits in the two vectors. For example, in Test Case 1 the left group is 3′b111 and the right group is 3′b000. Their bitwise AND becomes 3′b000, and when this 3-bit result is assigned to the single bit output p1y only one bit (usually the least significant) is used, which is 0. This mismatch between the intended logical operation and the actual bitwise vector operation is the root cause of the simulated error.

In summary, the error occurs because a bitwise AND on concatenated vectors produces a multi‐bit value that does not embody the intended logic. The fix is to change the design so that you correctly reduce each group into a single bit (for example, by using reduction operators or otherwise separating the checks) before performing the final AND.
