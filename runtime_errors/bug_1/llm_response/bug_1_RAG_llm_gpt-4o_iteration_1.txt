The error is occurring in the line where `p1y` is expected to be 1 for Test Case 1, but the simulation reports `p1y = 0`. Let's analyze the logic:

### Code Analysis:
The assignment in the `top_module` for `p1y` is:
```verilog
assign p1y =  {p1a, p1b, p1c}  &{p1d, p1e, p1f};
```

This line is performing a bitwise AND operation between the vectors `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` and `{p1d, p1e, p1f}`. Since `p1y` is a single-bit output, it results from the AND operation applied bit-wise across these two vectors:

- In Test Case 1, the vectors are `3'b111` and `3'b000`. The bitwise AND of these two is `3'b000`, which leads to `p1y = 0`.

### Expected Logic Based on Testbench:
The test bench is expecting `p1y` to be 1 if any of `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` or `{p1d, p1e, p1f}` is 1 individually. The expected behavior seems to aim for logic that outputs 1 when any grouping of inputs is true.

### Fixing the Logic:
If you want `p1y` to be 1 when any of the two group selections is 1, you should adjust the logic. A possible fix could be:
```verilog
assign p1y = |{p1a, p1b, p1c} | |{p1d, p1e, p1f};
```
Here, the OR reduction (`|`) of each group is combined with another OR operation (`|`), ensuring that `p1y` is 1 if any bit in either group is 1.

### Revised Code:
```verilog
assign p1y = |{p1a, p1b, p1c} | |{p1d, p1e, p1f};
```

This change should resolve the discrepancy between the test bench expectations and the actual logic behavior, allowing the tests to pass as expected.
