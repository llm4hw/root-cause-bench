The error occurs because the assignment for p1y is computing a bit‐wise AND of two 3‑bit vectors instead of performing a reduction that produces a single bit, which is what the test bench expects. In the first test case the upper group (p1a, p1b, p1c) is actually all ones, but the lower group (p1d, p1e, p1f) is all zeros. When you “AND” the corresponding bits of these two 3‑bit groups, every bit ends up being 0. Then only one bit is assigned to p1y, which becomes 0, even though the intention was for p1y to indicate that either one of the reductions was true (or to capture some other logical combination).

The bug is essentially due to the misuse of vector concatenation with the bit‐wise AND operator instead of applying a reduction operator (or a logical combination) on each group separately. This causes the logic to operate on each corresponding pair of bits (e.g. the most significant bit of the first group with the most significant bit of the second group, and so on) rather than reducing each group to a single binary value before combining them.

To fix this issue, the design should be modified to perform an appropriate reduction of each set of bits so that the resulting single‑bit outcomes can then be combined in the intended way.
