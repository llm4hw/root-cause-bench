The bug in this code is in the assignment of `p1y` and `p2y` in the `top_module`. The assignment statements for both `p1y` and `p2y` are not functioning as expected and may lead to incorrect behavior during simulation.

In the `top_module` code:
1. The assignment for `p1y` is using bitwise AND (`&`) with two concatenated groupings of bits. This is likely not the intended operation, and it causes the unexpected behavior during testing.
2. The assignment for `p2y` is using a similar bitwise AND operation with concatenated groupings of bits, which is also incorrect.

To fix this bug, the assignment statements for `p1y` and `p2y` should be modified to perform the intended logic operation based on the inputs provided in the module. Make sure to review the requirements of the design and then correct the assignment statements in the module accordingly.
