The issue is occurring because of the incorrect use of the bitwise AND operator (`&`) for the expected functionality.

### Root Cause:

In the `top_module`, the expression:

```verilog
assign p1y = {p1a, p1b, p1c} & {p1d, p1e, p1f};
```

This performs a bitwise AND operation between the two 3-bit vectors `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` and `{p1d, p1e, p1f}`. The result is a 3-bit vector. However, the result is assigned directly to `p1y`, which is a single bit. Thus, `p1y` will only take the value of the least significant bit of the 3-bit result. This will not accomplish the intended test cases.

### Expected Functionality:
1. Test case 1 expects `p1y` to be `1` if either `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` or `{p1d, p1e, p1f}` is composed only of `1`s.
2. Test case 2 suggests that the expected behavior might be to OR the results of logical operations on other signal groups.

### Suggested Fix:

To achieve the expected behavior based on the test cases, you need logical AND conditions that test for blocks of signals being all `1`s. Likely, `p1y` should be equal to `1` if **either** `{p1a, p1b, p1c}` or `{p1d, p1e, p1f}` are all `1`s, which indicates `p1y` should be determined by:

```verilog
assign p1y = (p1a & p1b & p1c) | (p1d & p1e & p1f);
```

### Explanation:
- `(p1a & p1b & p1c)` is `1` if `p1a`, `p1b`, and `p1c` are all `1`s.
- `(p1d & p1e & p1f)` is `1` if `p1d`, `p1e`, and `p1f` are all `1`s.
- The OR operation `|` combines the two results to ensure that `p1y` is `1` if either condition is satisfied.

Make this change in your module code, and rerun the simulation. The test cases should now pass.
