The error in your FSM code is related to the incorrect sensitivity list in the `always` block for the FSM sequential logic. Currently, the always block has the sensitivity list as `@(posedge reset)`. This implies the block is triggered on the rising edge of reset, which is incorrect. The block should instead be triggered by the clock to update the state based on the clock edges, which is typical behavior for sequential logic in a finite state machine (FSM).

Here are the steps to fix this:

1. **Modify the Sensitivity List**: The FSM should update its state on the rising edge of the clock, not the `reset`. The `reset` should be synchronous to the clock or handled with an asynchronous reset logic. Replace `@(posedge reset)` with `@(posedge clk or posedge reset)`.

Here's how you can fix the code:

```verilog
// FSM sequential logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= S0; // Default state on reset
        output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
        valid <= 0; // Default invalid
    end else begin
        if (num_in >= 0 && num_in <= 9) begin
            state <= num_in;
            valid <= 1;
        end else begin
            state <= S0; // Default state on invalid input
            output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
            valid <= 0; // Default invalid
        end
    end
end
```

The issue occurred because the FSM state was not being updated properly; it updated only when the reset was activated. The `output_data`, `state`, and `valid` signals did not reflect the current input and purpose of the FSM since their updates weren't in sync with the clock, leading to unexpected behavior and failure of the testbench.

By ensuring your logic updates on the clock edge, the `state` and related outputs are evaluated and updated correctly during each clock cycle, reflecting changes as per the testbench expectations.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....

Within the control unit module, the state memory is implemented as a separate procedural block that
will update the current state with the next state on each rising edge of the clock. The reset state will be the
ﬁrst fetch state in the FSM (i.e., S_FETCH_0). The following Verilog shows how the state memory in the
control unit can be modeled. Note that this block models sequential logic, so non-blocking assignments
are used....
