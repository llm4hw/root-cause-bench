The bug occurs because the state transitions and output assignments in the FSM are not synchronized to the clock. The sequential logic is triggered by `posedge reset` instead of `posedge clk`, causing the FSM to update **only during reset**. After reset is deasserted, the state never responds to input changes because the `always @(posedge reset)` block does not execute on clock edges. The `valid` signal and `state` updates depend on this missing clock synchronization, leaving them stuck in their reset values during normal operation. To fix this, the state transition logic must be driven by the clock (e.g., `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset`), ensuring updates on clock edges.
