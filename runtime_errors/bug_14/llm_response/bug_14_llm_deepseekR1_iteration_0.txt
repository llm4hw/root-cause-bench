The bug arises because the state transitions in the FSM's sequential logic block are not synchronized to the clock. The `always @(posedge reset)` block only triggers on reset events, not clock edges. This means:

1. **State transitions don't occur** when inputs change during normal operation (non-reset conditions), as the block isn't sensitive to the clock. The FSM remains in its initial state (S0) after reset is released.

2. **Outputs depend on unupdated states** - Since the state never changes from S0 after reset, the combinational output logic (triggered by state changes) produces default outputs (0s) instead of values corresponding to input-driven state transitions.

3. **Valid signal remains inactive** because it's only updated during reset events, not when valid inputs are applied during normal operation.

The design incorrectly treats reset as the sole synchronization event rather than using clock edges for state updates. The FSM is effectively non-functional after reset because it lacks clock-driven transitions.
