The error message indicates that Test 1 of your testbench failed because the expected values for `state`, `output_data`, and `valid` were not obtained. The expected values were `state=3`, `output_data=3`, `valid=1`, but instead, the test observed `0 0 0`.

The issue arises primarily due to the following factors:

1. **Reset Logic:** The current reset block in your FSM uses `@(posedge reset)`. This means the block is only sensitive to changes on the `reset` signal and updates the state when a positive edge of the reset occurs. As a result, the FSM is not operating on clock edges, which prevents it from updating the state and other outputs on clock cycles as intended.

2. **Sequential Logic Misplacement:** In a typical FSM design, the state transitions and outputs should be determined and updated synchronously with the clock signal's positive edge, not just on a condition of reset alone.

Due to these factors, your FSM is not clock-synchronized as expected, which can lead to unexpected results especially if `reset` is no longer high, causing no updates to occur.

To solve this issue, the FSM should be implemented in a way where the state transitions and output logic are synchronized with the clock. This generally involves changing the procedural block to react on the `clk` edge to ensure that the FSM properly transitions states and outputs data according to the clock signal after the reset process is complete.

The key points that need adjustment are:
- Trigger the FSM logic with the clock signal, not just the reset.
- Consider using `@(posedge clk or posedge reset)` to ensure the state is reset synchronously as well during the regular clock cycle and asynchronous reset if required.

By modifying the logic to update state and output data based on the clock, you ensure that the FSM operates in a predictable manner according to typical synchronous logic design practices, fixing the issue observed in the test case.
