The error message "pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got 11" occurs during the simulation of your test bench. Let's analyze your code to determine the root cause and potential fix.

### Code Analysis
1. **State Transition Logic:**
   - When `pedControl` is activated, the state transitions from `Red` to `Ped` but it remains in state `Ped` according to your state transition logic:
      ```verilog
      Ped: next = Ped;
      ```
   - The expected behavior is for `Ped` to transition to `Green` according to your test bench. However, due to the default `next = Red;` in the `Ped` state, it remains in the `Ped` state (__signal 11__) instead of transitioning to `Green` (__signal 01__).

2. **Fix the state transition from `Ped`:**
   - In your state transition block, you should add a logic to transition from `Ped` to `Green` when `pedControl` is deactivated.
   
Here's the corrected portion of the code:
```verilog
always@(state or pedControl) begin
    case (state)
        Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
             else next = Green;
        Green: next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        Ped: if (~pedControl) next = Green; // Transition to Green when pedControl is deactivated
             else next = Ped;
        default: next = Red;
    endcase
end
```

### Explanation
- By adding `if (~pedControl) next = Green;` in the `Ped` state, the FSM will now transition to `Green` when the pedestrian control signal is deactivated, which matches the expected behavior in your test bench.

This fix should resolve the error and allow your test bench to run successfully without incorrectly remaining in the `Ped` state when `pedControl` is deactivated.

A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the
path.  A special specparam constant can be used to control whether the pulse
will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
