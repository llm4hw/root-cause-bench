The bug in the code is occurring because the comparison using `!==` in the if statements of the testbench is incorrect. The `!==` operator is not valid in Verilog, and it is causing the comparison to always evaluate to true, resulting in the error messages being displayed.

To fix this issue, you should use `!=` for comparison instead of `!==`. Replace all instances of `!==` with `!=` in the if statements of the testbench code. Here is how the problematic if statements should be corrected:

Before:
```verilog
if (outResult !== 2'b00)
if (outResult !== 2'b01)
if (outResult !== 2'b10)
if (outResult !== 2'b00)
if (outResult !== 2'b11)
if (outResult !== 2'b01)
```

After:
```verilog
if (outResult != 2'b00)
if (outResult != 2'b01)
if (outResult != 2'b10)
if (outResult != 2'b00)
if (outResult != 2'b11)
if (outResult != 2'b01)
```

Making this correction should resolve the comparison error in the testbench, allowing the simulation to run correctly and deliver the expected results without the error messages.

A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the

will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
