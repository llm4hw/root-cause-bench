The error you're encountering arises from how the state transition for the pedestrian control is being handled in the Verilog code. According to your design, the transition from the `Red` state goes to the `Ped` state when `pedControl` is activated and should hold there. However, you are expecting it to subsequently move to the `Green` state after a delay in your testbench, which is not aligned with the current state machine design in your `top_module`.

### Analysis:

- The state machine in the provided Verilog code transitions as follows:
  - `Red`: transitions to `Ped` if `pedControl` is high; otherwise, it transitions to `Green`.
  - `Ped`: the current implementation of the state machine holds `Ped` as the next state, effectively creating a latch there.
  - There is no provision to move from `Ped` back to `Green`, neither when `pedControl` is high nor low.

### Why the Error Occurs:

Your testbench expects the state to move from `Ped` to `Green` automatically. However, in your code, once the state goes to `Ped`, it stays there indefinitely due to the transition:
```verilog
Ped: next = Ped;
```

### Fix:

To move from `Ped` to any other state (in your case, to `Green`), you need to define a condition under which the state should transition out of `Ped`. Here is how you can modify the state transition logic:

1. Add logic to transition from `Ped` back to `Green`:
   ```verilog
   Ped: if (~pedControl) next = Green;
   ```

With this change, your state machine will leave the `Ped` state and transition to the `Green` state once `pedControl` is deactivated (logical 0). This change aligns the state transitions with the expectations set in the testbench. Here's how this revised segment looks:

```verilog
case (state)
    Red: 
        if (pedControl) 
            next = Ped;
        else 
            next = Green;
    Green: 
        next = Yellow;
    Yellow: 
        next = Red;
    Ped: 
        if (~pedControl) 
            next = Green;
    default: 
        next = Red;
endcase
```

This modification ensures that, given your testbench's expectations, the state will correctly transition from `Ped` back to `Green` once `pedControl` is deactivated.
