The bug is occurring because the comparison in the testbench for pedControl 2 is checking for `2'b01` instead of `2'b11`. The expected output for the scenario when pedControl is activated should be `2'b11` (Ped), not `2'b01` (Green), as indicated by the error message "ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got 11". 

To fix this issue, you should update the comparison in the testbench after setting pedControl to 1:

Change:
```verilog
if (outResult !== 2'b01) begin
    $display("pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end
```

To:
```verilog
if (outResult !== 2'b11) begin
    $display("pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Ped (11), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end
```

By making this change, you will correctly check for the expected output value `2'b11` (Ped) when pedControl is activated, resolving the error message discrepancy.

15.2 Path Pulse (Glitch) Detection
A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the
path.  A special specparam constant can be used to control whether the pulse
will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
