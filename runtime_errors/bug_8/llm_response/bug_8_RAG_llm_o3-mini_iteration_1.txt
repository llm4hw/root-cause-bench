The error "pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got 11" is happening because your state machine gets “stuck” in the Ped state (which outputs 2'b11). In your state transition block you have:

  Ped: next = Ped;

This means that once the state machine enters the Ped state (when pedControl is active), it will remain in that state indefinitely. However, your test bench expects that after one cycle in Ped one should have a transition to Green. In other words, the intended sequence under pedControl should be: Red → Ped → Green, but your FSM never moves out of Ped.

To fix the issue, modify the state transition for the Ped state. For example, if you intend for the FSM to move from Ped to Green in the next cycle, change the Ped case to:

  Ped: next = Green;

This way, when pedControl is active and the FSM goes to Ped briefly, it will then transition to Green on the next clock edge. That change will cause the output to correctly change from 2'b11 (Ped) back to 2'b01 (Green) as the test bench expects.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

15.2 Path Pulse (Glitch) Detection
A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the
path.  A special specparam constant can be used to control whether the pulse
will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
