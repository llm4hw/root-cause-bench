The bug is in the state transition logic for the `Ped` state. The design's state machine gets stuck in the `Ped` state indefinitely because the next state is always set to `Ped`, regardless of the `pedControl` input. However, the testbench expects the state to transition from `Ped` to `Green` after one clock cycle, even while `pedControl` remains asserted.

**Why it occurs:**
In the original code, the `Ped` state's next state is hardcoded to `Ped`:
```verilog
Ped: next = Ped;
```
This causes the state machine to remain in `Ped` indefinitely once entered. The testbench expects a transition to `Green` after one cycle in `Ped`, but the design does not implement this transition.

**Fix:**
Modify the `Ped` state's next state logic to transition to `Green`:
```verilog
Ped: next = Green; // Transition to Green after Ped
```

**Corrected code section:**
```verilog
always@(state or pedControl) begin
    case (state)
        Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
            else next = Green;
        Green: next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        Ped: next = Green; // Fix: Transition to Green
        default: next = Red;
    endcase
end
```

**Explanation:**
- The updated code ensures that after entering the `Ped` state, the next state will be `Green` on the subsequent clock cycle.
- This aligns the design with the testbench's expectation of transitioning from `Ped` to `Green`, resolving the error where the state was stuck in `Ped`.

**Note:** If the intended behavior requires the `Ped` state to depend on `pedControl` (e.g., stay in `Ped` only while `pedControl` is active), additional logic would be needed. However, based on the testbench's expectations, transitioning to `Green` unconditionally fixes the reported error.
