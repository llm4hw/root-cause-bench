The bug in the code is that the `outResult` comparison checks are using the `!==` operator instead of the `!=` operator. The `!==` operator in SystemVerilog does a bitwise comparison, but in this case, we want to compare the entire 2-bit value as a whole.

To fix this bug, you need to replace every instance of `!==` with `!=` in the testbench code where you are comparing `outResult` to the expected values. 

Here is the corrected part of the testbench code:

```verilog
#10;
if (outResult != 2'b00) begin
    $display("1 - ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (outResult != 2'b01) begin
    $display("2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (outResult != 2'b10) begin
    $display("3 - ERROR: Expected Yellow (10), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (outResult != 2'b00) begin
    $display("4 - ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end

// Activate PedControl -- Red -> Ped -> Green
pedControl = 1;
#10;
if (outResult != 2'b11) begin
    $display("pedControl 1 - ERROR: Expected Ped (11), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end

#10;
if (outResult != 2'b01) begin
    $display("pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got %b", outResult);
    $fatal;
end
```

After making this change, rerun the simulation to verify that the issue has been resolved.

the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the

will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
