The error message you've encountered is: `pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got 11`. This indicates that during the simulation, the module incorrectly output `11` (which corresponds to the `Ped` state) instead of `01` (the `Green` state) when it was expected to transition from the `Ped` state to the `Green` state.

The issue lies in the handling of the `Ped` state in the state transition logic:

```verilog
Ped: next = Ped;
```

With this line, the FSM (Finite State Machine) is designed to remain in the `Ped` state indefinitely because the next state is always assigned to be `Ped`, and it doesn't transition to any other state.

### Root Cause

The test expects the system to move from the `Ped` state back to the `Green` state, possibly indicating pedestrian flow is done after one period, but your current logic makes it remain in the `Ped` state indefinitely. 

### Fix

Adjust the state transition logic so that after the `Ped` state, it transitions to the `Green` state after enough time or under specific conditions (e.g., after a successful pedestrian crossing). This can be accomplished in several ways; here is a direct approach:

```verilog
Ped: next = Green;  // Transition from Ped to Green
```

By making this change, the FSM will transition from `Ped` to `Green`, satisfying the test bench expectations. Here‚Äôs the updated section:

```verilog
always@(state or pedControl) begin
    case (state)
        Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
             else next = Green;
        Green: next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        Ped: next = Green;  // New transition
        default: next = Red;
    endcase
end
```

This should resolve the error during the simulation by aligning the state transitions with the test bench's expectations.
