The bug occurs because the state machine gets stuck in the `Ped` state. In the design's next state logic, once the `Ped` state is entered, the next state remains `Ped` indefinitely. However, the testbench expects the state to transition from `Ped` to `Green` after one clock cycle, leading to an error when the output remains `11` (Ped) instead of transitioning to `01` (Green).

**Root Cause**:  
The `Ped` state's next state is incorrectly set to `Ped` in the case statement:
```verilog
Ped: next = Ped;
```
This causes the state machine to loop indefinitely in the `Ped` state once entered, violating the testbench's expectation of transitioning to `Green`.

**Fix**:  
Modify the next state logic for the `Ped` state to transition to `Green`:
```verilog
Ped: next = Green;
```

**Corrected Code Snippet**:
```verilog
always@(state or pedControl) begin
    case (state)
        Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
             else next = Green;
        Green: next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        Ped: next = Green; // Fix: Transition to Green
        default: next = Red;
    endcase
end
```

**Explanation**:  
By changing the `Ped` state's next state to `Green`, the state machine will transition to `Green` on the next clock cycle after entering `Ped`. This aligns with the testbench's expectation, resolving the error where the design was stuck in `Ped`. The test case now correctly transitions from `Red -> Ped -> Green`, allowing the test to pass.

A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the

will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
