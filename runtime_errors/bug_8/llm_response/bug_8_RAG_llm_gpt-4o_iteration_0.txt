The issue you're facing is due to incorrect state transition logic from the `Ped` state in your `top_module` Verilog code. Let's analyze why this is happening and how to fix it:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - The error message "pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got 11" indicates that during the testbench when `pedControl` is activated, the expected state transition from `Ped` state to `Green` state did not occur. Instead of transitioning to `Green`, the system is stuck in the `Ped` state (outputting `11`).
   - This is because, in your case statement for state transitions, you've defined `Ped` to always transition to itself:
     ```verilog
     Ped: next = Ped;
     ```

2. **Fix Explanation:**
   - Modify the transition logic for the `Ped` state in the `always@(state or pedControl)` block. After a pedestrian request (i.e., `Ped` state), the system should be able to transition to `Green` (or directly to another state based on your desired traffic light sequence), but certainly not back to `Ped` indefinitely.

3. **Corrected Code:**
   - Let's change the `Ped` state logic to transition to `Green`:
     ```verilog
     always @(state or pedControl) begin
         case (state)
             Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
                  else next = Green;
             Green: next = Yellow;
             Yellow: next = Red;
             Ped: next = Green; // Change from Ped: next = Ped; to Ped: next = Green;
             default: next = Red;
         endcase
     end
     ```

With this change, in your testbench, after setting `pedControl = 1`, the system will move from the `Ped` state to the `Green` state, which matches your expected output and resolves the error.

A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the

(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
