The bug occurs because the state machine gets stuck in the `Ped` state indefinitely. This is due to the `next` state being set to `Ped` within the `Ped` case, preventing any transition out of that state. 

**Why it's happening:**  
In the state transition logic:
```verilog
Ped: next = Ped;
```
Once the state enters `Ped`, the `next` state remains `Ped` regardless of `pedControl`. The testbench expects the state to transition to `Green` after `Ped`, but the design does not implement this transition.

**Fix:**  
Modify the `Ped` case to transition to `Green` instead of staying in `Ped`:
```verilog
Ped: next = Green; // Corrected line
```

**Explanation:**  
This change ensures that after entering the `Ped` state, the state machine transitions to `Green` on the next clock cycle, aligning with the testbench's expected behavior. The `Ped` state now acts as a transient state, allowing normal operation to resume.

15.2 Path Pulse (Glitch) Detection
A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the
path.  A special specparam constant can be used to control whether the pulse
will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
