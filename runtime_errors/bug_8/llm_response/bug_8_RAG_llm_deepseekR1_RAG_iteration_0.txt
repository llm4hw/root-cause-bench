The bug is in the state transition logic for the Ped state. The state machine remains in the Ped state indefinitely because the next state is incorrectly set to Ped, while the testbench expects it to transition to Green after one cycle.

**Why it's occurring:**
In the `always@(state or pedControl)` block, the Ped state's next state is assigned as `next = Ped;`, creating an infinite loop in the Ped state. The testbench activates `pedControl` while in the Red state, transitions to Ped, and then expects a transition to Green in the next cycle. However, the design gets stuck in Ped due to the incorrect next state assignment.

**Fix:**
Modify the Ped state's next state assignment to transition to Green instead of staying in Ped. Update the case statement for the Ped state:

```verilog
always@(state or pedControl) begin
    case (state)
        Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
             else next = Green;
        Green: next = Yellow;
        Yellow: next = Red;
        Ped: next = Green;  // Corrected line: Transition to Green after Ped
        default: next = Red;
    endcase
end
```

**Explanation:**
By setting `next = Green` in the Ped state, the state machine will transition to Green on the next clock cycle after entering Ped. This aligns with the testbench's expectation and resolves the error where the design remained stuck in Ped.
