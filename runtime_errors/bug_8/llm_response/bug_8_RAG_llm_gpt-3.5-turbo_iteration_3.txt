The error message "pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got 11" indicates that there is an issue with the value of `outResult` when `pedControl` is active. In the testbench, it is expected that `outResult` should be `2'b01` (Green) after `pedControl` is activated, but it is actually showing `2'b11` (Ped) instead.

The bug is occurring because the check for `outResult` after the `pedControl` transition is happening immediately after setting `pedControl` to 1. The `outResult` value is evaluated instantly without waiting for the changes in the module due to the positive edge of the clock.

To fix this issue, you can introduce a delay after setting `pedControl` to 1 before checking the `outResult`. This will allow the module to update its state based on the clock cycle. Simply add a delay before checking the `outResult` after `pedControl` is activated, like this:

```verilog
#10;
```

Adding a delay before checking the `outResult` in the testbench will synchronize the check with the clock cycle, ensuring that the correct value is being evaluated after the `pedControl` transition.

15.2 Path Pulse (Glitch) Detection
A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the
path.  A special specparam constant can be used to control whether the pulse
will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
