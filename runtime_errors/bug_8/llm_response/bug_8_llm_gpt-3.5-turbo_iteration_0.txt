The bug in the code lies in the testbench verification of the scenario where the `pedControl` signal is activated. Specifically, the error message "pedControl 2 - ERROR: Expected Green (01), but got 11" is being triggered because the testbench is checking for the `outResult` immediately after transitioning to `Ped`, where it should be verifying the output after the subsequent state transition to `Green`.

This error is happening because the `pedControl` signal transitions to `1` and puts the state to `Ped` within the same time frame as the assertion check for `Green` in the testbench. Hence, the output verification is not aligned with the actual behavior of the state machine in the DUT.

To fix this bug, you would need to adjust the timing in the testbench code such that when setting `pedControl` to `1`, you wait for the subsequent clock cycle to verify the output when the state transitions to `Green`. This would ensure that the output verification matches the expected behavior of the state machine in the design.
