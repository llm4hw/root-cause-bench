The problem is not with the testbench but with the finite state machine. In your implementation, when the state is Ped you are always forcing the next state to remain Ped:

  case (state)
   Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
      else next = Green;
   Green: next = Yellow;
   Yellow: next = Red;
   Ped: next = Ped;
   default: next = Red;
  endcase

Because the Ped state never transitions out (it always sets next = Ped), the output remains 2’b11 (i.e. Ped) on the second “pedControl” test case, even though your testbench expects it to change to Green (2’b01).

The fix is to modify the state transition for the Ped state so that once pedControl is no longer intended to hold the Ped state (or after one clock cycle) it transitions to Green. For example, you can modify the Ped case as follows:

  Ped: next = (pedControl) ? Ped : Green;

This way, when pedControl is active the FSM stays in Ped, but when pedControl is deasserted the next state becomes Green as expected by the testbench.

Thus, the root cause of the error is that the FSM never leaves the Ped state due to its unconditional “next = Ped” assignment. Changing that to allow a transition to Green (or whichever state is intended) resolves the issue.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

15.2 Path Pulse (Glitch) Detection
A pulse is a glitch on the inputs of a module path that is less than the delay of the
path.  A special specparam constant can be used to control whether the pulse
will propagate to the output (transport delay), not propagate to the output
(inertial delay), or result in a logic X on the output.
