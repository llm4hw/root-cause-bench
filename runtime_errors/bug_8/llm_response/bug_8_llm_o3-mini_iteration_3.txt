The root of the error is that once the FSM enters the Ped state, it never leaves that state. In the combinational logic that calculates the next state, when the current state is Ped, the next state is unconditionally set to Ped (a self-loop). This means that when pedControl is activated to force a transition from Red to Ped, the machine remains in the Ped state indefinitely. The testbench expects that after being in Ped, the FSM would eventually transition to Green. However, because the Ped state never transitions out, the output remains at 11 (representing Ped) instead of changing to 01 (representing Green).

This issue occurs because the state transition logic for the Ped state is not implemented to eventually leave the Ped state. The correction involves modifying the state transition for Ped so that the FSM exits Ped (for example, to Green) at the appropriate time.
