The error in your code arises from the incorrect implementation of the `o_carry` output. The issue is primarily with how you are calculating the `o_carry` in the `full_half_add_1bit` module. The logic for determining the `carry` in a full adder using two half adders should consider both intermediate carries obtained from each of the half adders.

Currently, the implementation for `o_carry` is:
```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2;
```

This is incorrect because in a full adder constructed from two half adders, the carry out should be computed as:
```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

### Explanation:
- In a full adder design using two half adders, you have:
  - `w_carry1` which is the carry from the first half adder: when both `i_a` and `i_b` are high (`1`).
  - `w_carry2` which is the carry from the second half adder, taking `w_sum1` (the sum from the first half adder) and `i_cin` as inputs.

The overall carry output `o_carry` should be a logical OR of `w_carry1` and `w_carry2` because if there is a carry from either half adder, then the full adder needs to account for it.

### Correct Implementation:
Change the line that calculates `o_carry` to:
```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

With this correction, your full adder should produce the correct carry output for the provided test cases. This fix should resolve the issue for Test Case 3, in which you expected a carry-out of `1`.
