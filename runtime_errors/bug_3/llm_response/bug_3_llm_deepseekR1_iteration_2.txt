The bug occurs because the carry output logic in the full adder is incorrect. In a standard full adder constructed from two half adders, the final carry should be the logical OR of the individual carries from each half adder. However, the current code uses an AND operation (`w_carry1 & w_carry2`), which incorrectly suppresses the carry when only one of the half adders produces a carry. 

**Why this causes Test Case 3 to fail:**
- When `i_a=1`, `i_b=1`, `i_cin=0`, the first half adder (`h1`) generates `w_carry1=1` (correct). The second half adder (`h2`) adds `w_sum1=0` (from `h1`) and `i_cin=0`, producing `w_carry2=0`. 
- The AND operation `1 & 0` results in `o_carry=0` instead of the expected `1`, which would have been achieved with an OR (`1 | 0`). 

**Fix:** Replace the AND operator (`&`) in the `o_carry` assignment with an OR operator (`||`). This ensures that any carry generated by either half adder propagates to the final carry output.
