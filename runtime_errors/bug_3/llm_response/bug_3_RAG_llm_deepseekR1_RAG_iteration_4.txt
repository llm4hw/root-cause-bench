The bug is in the calculation of the carry-out (`o_carry`) in the full adder module. The code incorrectly uses a logical AND (`&`) to combine the intermediate carry signals (`w_carry1` and `w_carry2`) when it should use a logical OR (`|`).

**Why it occurs:**
- In a full adder built from two half adders, the final carry-out is the **OR** of:
  1. The carry generated by the first half adder (`w_carry1`, from `A & B`).
  2. The carry generated by the second half adder (`w_carry2`, from `(A ⊕ B) & Cin`).
- The current code erroneously computes `o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2`, which under-reports carries. For Test Case 3 (`1 + 1 + 0`), this results in `1 & 0 = 0` instead of the correct `1 | 0 = 1`.

**Fix:**
Change the line in `full_half_add_1bit`:
```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2;
```
to:
```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

**Explanation:**
The full adder’s carry-out must account for *either* the first half adder producing a carry (from `A & B`) *or* the second half adder producing a carry (from `(A ⊕ B) & Cin`). Using an OR gate correctly combines these two cases. This matches the standard full adder implementation using two half adders and ensures proper carry propagation.
