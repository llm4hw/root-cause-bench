The problem stems from the way the final carry output is produced in the full adder module. In a correctly implemented full adder, the final carry should be the logical OR of the carry from the first half adder (from the two main inputs) and the carry generated by the second half adder (which processes the XOR of the inputs with the carry-in). However, in the provided code the two partial carry outputs are combined using an AND operator. 

For example, with inputs 1, 1, and 0:
• The first half adder computes a sum (1 XOR 1) of 0 and a carry (1 AND 1) of 1.
• The second half adder then takes the 0 (from the previous sum) and the 0 carry-in to produce a sum of 0 and a carry of (0 AND 0) which is 0.
• Finally, the full adder combines the two half-adder carries using an AND. Therefore, 1 (first carry) AND 0 (second carry) yields 0, which is not the expected result (which should be 1).

This bug occurs because the design uses an AND operator where a logical OR operator is needed. The fix would involve using an OR combination for the two partial carries so that if either one is high, the final carry will be correctly set.
