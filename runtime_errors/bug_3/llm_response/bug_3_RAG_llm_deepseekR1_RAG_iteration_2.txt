The bug is in the calculation of the carry output (`o_carry`) in the `full_half_add_1bit` module. The error occurs because the final carry is computed using an **AND** gate (`w_carry1 & w_carry2`) instead of an **OR** gate. 

### Root Cause:
In a full adder constructed from two half adders:
1. The first half adder computes the sum of `A + B`, producing an intermediate sum (`w_sum1`) and carry (`w_carry1`).
2. The second half adder adds `w_sum1` and `C_in`, producing the final sum (`o_sum`) and another intermediate carry (`w_carry2`).
3. The **final carry** should be the logical **OR** of `w_carry1` and `w_carry2`, as a carry occurs if **either** of the half adders generates a carry. 

Using an **AND** gate here is incorrect because it only asserts the carry when **both** intermediate carries are `1`, which violates the correct behavior of a full adder.

---

### Fix:
Replace the **AND** operation with an **OR** operation in the assignment of `o_carry`:

```verilog
// Original (incorrect)
assign o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2;

// Fixed (correct)
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

### Explanation:
- **Test Case 3** (`1 + 1 + 0`):
  - First half adder: `1 + 1` → sum `0`, carry `1` (`w_carry1 = 1`).
  - Second half adder: `0 + 0` → sum `0`, carry `0` (`w_carry2 = 0`).
  - With the bug: `1 & 0 = 0` (incorrect carry `0`).
  - After fix: `1 | 0 = 1` (correct carry `1`).

This resolves the error in Test Case 3 and ensures the full adder behaves correctly for all inputs.
