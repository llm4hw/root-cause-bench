The bug in the provided code is occurring due to the incorrect instantiation of the module `full_half_add_1bit` in the testbench `tb_full_half_add_1bit`.

The instantiation in the testbench is not correctly connecting the inputs `i_a`, `i_b`, and `i_cin` to the module `full_half_add_1bit`. The testbench is using 3-bit values for `i_a`, `i_b`, and `i_cin`, but the module `full_half_add_1bit` is designed to take single-bit inputs. This issue leads to incorrect values being passed to the module, resulting in incorrect output values for `o_sum` and `o_carry`.

To fix this bug, the testbench should assign single-bit input values to `i_a`, `i_b`, and `i_cin` instead of 3-bit values. Additionally, the testbench should ensure that inputs are only 0 or 1 to match the design of the module. By making these corrections, the testbench can correctly test the functionality of the module `full_half_add_1bit`.
