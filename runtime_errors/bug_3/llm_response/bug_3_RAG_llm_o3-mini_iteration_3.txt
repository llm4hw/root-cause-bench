The bug is in how the carry output (o_carry) is computed in the full adder module. Instead of combining the carry outputs from the two half adders with an OR operation, the code uses an AND operation.

Here's what happens in Test Case 3 (i_a=1, i_b=1, i_cin=0):

1. The first half adder (h1) calculates:
   - Sum: 1 XOR 1 = 0 (w_sum1)
   - Carry: 1 AND 1 = 1 (w_carry1)

2. The second half adder (h2) calculates:
   - Sum: 0 XOR 0 = 0 (o_sum)
   - Carry: 0 AND 0 = 0 (w_carry2)

3. The final full adder carry is computed as:
   - o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2 = 1 & 0 = 0

However, the expected carry is 1 since a carry from either half adder should propagate out. The correct logic is to use an OR operation, so that if either the first half adder generates a carry or the second does, the final o_carry is asserted.

To fix the issue, change the assign statement in the full adder module from:

  assign o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2;

to

  assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;

This correction will ensure that the final carry output is correctly generated according to full adder logic.
