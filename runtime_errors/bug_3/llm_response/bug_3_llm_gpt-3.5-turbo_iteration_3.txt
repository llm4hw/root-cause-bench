The bug in this case is occurring because the initial values assigned to `i_a`, `i_b`, and `i_cin` in the testbench module `tb_full_half_add_1bit` are being provided as 3-bit values (e.g., `3'b000`, `3'b100`, `3'b110`, `3'b111`) whereas the inputs `i_a`, `i_b`, and `i_cin` defined in the module `full_half_add_1bit` are declared as single bits in the port declaration (`input i_a, i_b, i_cin;`).

Because the inputs `i_a`, `i_b`, and `i_cin` are being driven with 3-bit values from the testbench, the simulation is not properly reflecting the expected behavior for a 1-bit full adder. This discrepancy is causing the comparison in the test cases to fail.

The bug can be fixed by updating the assignment of `i_a`, `i_b`, and `i_cin` in the test cases to be single bits instead of 3-bit values. This change will align the testbench inputs with the expected behavior of a 1-bit full adder as defined in the `full_half_add_1bit` module, resolving the simulation error.
