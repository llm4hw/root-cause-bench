The error message indicates that Test Case 3 failed because the expected output (Sum = 0, Carry = 1) did not match the actual output (Sum = 0, Carry = 0).

The root cause of this issue lies in the way the carry out (`o_carry`) is calculated in the full adder module `full_half_add_1bit`. The current implementation uses the assignment:

```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2;
```

This logic is incorrect for a full adder. A full adder needs to account for two possible carry conditions:
1. A carry from the addition of the inputs `i_a` and `i_b` (which is `w_carry1`).
2. A carry from the intermediate sum `w_sum1` and the input carry `i_cin` (which is `w_carry2`).
3. Additionally, both carries being true leads to a final carry as well.

The correct logic should be:

```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

But this is still not entirely accurate for a full adder. A full adder's carry out is the result of either:
- Both primary inputs have a carry (which is `w_carry1`), or 
- The carry from the first stage added to the intermediate sum (which is `(w_sum1 & i_cin)`).

Thus, the correct assignment should be:

```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

The above combination will ensure that a carry out is generated if either of the half adders generates a carry signal.

To fix the issue, replace the existing `assign` statement for `o_carry` with:

```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

By updating the code with the correct logic, Test Case 3 should pass successfully, as it now accurately models a full adder using the two half adders.
