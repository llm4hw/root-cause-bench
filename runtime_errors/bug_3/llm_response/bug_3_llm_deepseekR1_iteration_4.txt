The bug is in the calculation of the `o_carry` signal. The full adder's carry-out should be the logical OR of the two half-adder carry signals (`w_carry1` and `w_carry2`), but the code incorrectly uses an AND operation. This causes `o_carry` to be 0 when only one of the half-adders produces a carry, which is incorrect. For Test Case 3, where both inputs to the first half-adder are 1, `w_carry1` is 1 and `w_carry2` is 0. The AND operation results in 0 instead of the expected 1 (from 1 OR 0). Replacing the AND operator (`&`) with an OR operator (`|`) in the assignment of `o_carry` resolves this error.
