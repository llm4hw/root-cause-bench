The bug in the code is most likely due to the sensitivity list not being properly defined in the always block in the full_half_add_1bit module. The always block is missing a sensitivity list that specifies when the block should trigger. 

To fix the issue, you should update the always block in the full_half_add_1bit module to include the inputs (i_a, i_b, i_cin) in the sensitivity list. This will ensure that the block is triggered when any of these inputs change, allowing the simulation to produce accurate results.

Here is an example of how the always block should be updated:

```verilog
always @ (i_a, i_b, i_cin)
begin
    // Your existing code here
end
```

Adding the sensitivity list will ensure that the simulation reacts correctly to input changes, addressing the error message generated during the simulation of Test Case 3.
