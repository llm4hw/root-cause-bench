The problem is in the way the `o_carry` output is assigned in the module `full_half_add_1bit`. The line:

```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2;
```

This line uses the logical AND operation, which is incorrect for determining the carry-out of a full adder. A full adder generates a carry when either of the following conditions is met:

1. Both `i_a` and `i_b` are 1, which is captured by `w_carry1`.
2. The sum of `i_a` and `i_b` (`w_sum1`) is 1 and the carry-in (`i_cin`) is also 1, captured by `w_carry2`.

The correct logic for `o_carry` should involve an OR operation, since carry can occur in either of these situations. The fix is to modify the line for `o_carry` as follows:

```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;
```

With this change, the `o_carry` will be correctly assigned when there is a carry-out from either half-adder, thus reflecting the correct behavior of a full adder. The test case 3 will then pass, as it requires a carry-out when both inputs `i_a` and `i_b` are 1 and `i_cin` is 0, resulting in `o_carry` being 1.
