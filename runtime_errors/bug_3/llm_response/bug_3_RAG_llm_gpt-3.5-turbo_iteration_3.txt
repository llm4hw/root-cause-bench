The bug seems to be occurring because the full adder implementation is actually a cascaded combination of two half adders. The issue arises in the scenario when there is no carry in (i_cin) provided to the first half adder, causing the second half adder to work as a full adder.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the `full_half_add_1bit` module to accommodate the carry in correctly. One way to do this is to make sure that the first half adder receives the correct inputs. You can modify the testbench to provide a carry input (i_cin) for all test cases, even if it's a 0. This adjustment will ensure that both half adders always receive the necessary inputs for proper operation as expected in a full adder configuration. 

Remember that a full adder should always take into account the carry from the previous bit, which is why ensuring a proper carry in for each bit calculation is crucial for accurate results.
