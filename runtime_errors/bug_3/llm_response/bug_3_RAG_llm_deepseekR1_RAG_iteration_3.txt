The bug in the code is that the final carry output (`o_carry`) of the full adder is incorrectly computed using an AND operation instead of an OR operation. 

**Why it's occurring:**
- In a full adder constructed from two half adders, the final carry-out should be the logical OR of the carry outputs from both half adders (`w_carry1` and `w_carry2`). This is because a carry occurs if **either** the first half adder (due to `A & B`) or the second half adder (due to intermediate sum `A⊕B` & `Cin`) generates a carry.
- The current code erroneously uses `w_carry1 & w_carry2` (AND), which only asserts the carry if **both** half adders produce a carry. This is incorrect and causes Test Case 3 to fail (e.g., `1 + 1 + 0` should produce `carry=1`, but the AND operation results in `0`).

**Fix:**
Replace the AND operator (`&`) with an OR operator (`|`) in the assignment of `o_carry`:
```verilog
assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;  // OR instead of AND
```

**Explanation:**
- For inputs `A=1`, `B=1`, `Cin=0` (Test Case 3):
  1. First half adder: `1 + 1` → `sum=0`, `w_carry1=1`.
  2. Second half adder: `0 (sum from first) + 0 (Cin)` → `sum=0`, `w_carry2=0`.
  3. Final carry should be `1 | 0 = 1` (correct), not `1 & 0 = 0` (incorrect).
- The OR operation correctly captures all scenarios where a carry is generated in a full adder.
