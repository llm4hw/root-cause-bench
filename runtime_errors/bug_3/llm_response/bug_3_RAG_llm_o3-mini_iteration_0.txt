The bug is in the final carry output of the full adder. Instead of using an OR operation for the two half-adder carry outputs, the code uses an AND operation. 

Here’s what happens in the failing case (Test Case 3: 1 + 1 + 0):

• First half adder: Inputs (i_a, i_b) = (1, 1)  
  – Sum (w_sum1) = 1 XOR 1 = 0  
  – Carry (w_carry1) = 1 AND 1 = 1

• Second half adder: Inputs (w_sum1, i_cin) = (0, 0)  
  – Sum (o_sum) = 0 XOR 0 = 0  
  – Carry (w_carry2) = 0 AND 0 = 0

The code then assigns the overall carry as:
  assign o_carry = w_carry1 & w_carry2; → 1 & 0 = 0  
However, the expected carry should be 1 (since a carry is generated when i_a and i_b are both 1, regardless of i_cin).

To fix this, you need to change the logic to OR the two carries:
  assign o_carry = w_carry1 | w_carry2;

This correctly computes the full adder’s carry because a carry is output if either of the half adders produces a carry.
