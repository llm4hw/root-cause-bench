The bug in the code is occurring in the part that handles the letter 'O' in the morse_code module. Specifically, the issue lies in the cases O_DASH1, O_DASH2, and O_DASH3. In these cases, the state transitions to the IDLE state after reaching the DASH duration. However, this logic is incorrect as it should be transitioning to the SPACE_STATE instead of directly going to IDLE after completing the DASH duration for the letter 'O'. 

This bug leads to the error message "ERROR: Morse for O not correct" during the simulation of the test bench because the output morse_out is not expected to be high for the letter 'O' based on the expected morse code pattern of '---'.

To fix this bug, the state transitions in the cases O_DASH1, O_DASH2, and O_DASH3 need to be updated to transition to the SPACE_STATE after completing the DASH duration instead of directly transitioning to IDLE.

Once this modification is made, the simulation should proceed correctly, and the error message for the letter 'O' should no longer occur.
