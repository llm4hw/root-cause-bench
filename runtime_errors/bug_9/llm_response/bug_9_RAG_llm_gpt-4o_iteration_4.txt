The error occurs in the implementation of the Morse code for the letter 'O', which is supposed to be represented by three dashes ("---"). Let's examine why the error might be happening.

### Root Cause Analysis:

1. **State Transition for 'O'**:
   - For the 'O' case, you have three states: `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3`, all of which have similar behavior to generate a dash.
   - However, in the current implementation, each DASH state is immediately followed by a transition back to `IDLE` after one DASH period (`counter < DASH`). This results in only a single DASH output, because it resets after each dash.

2. **Issue in State Management**:
   - Unlike for 'A' where SPACE_STATE manages the transition between DOT and DASH, for O_DASH states each dash is immediately concluded without transitioning to the next dash state.
   - This means that the state machine returns to `IDLE` and does not produce the full "---" for 'O'.

### Fix:

To correctly generate three consecutive dashes for 'O', you need transitions between `O_DASH1` to `O_DASH2` and then `O_DASH2` to `O_DASH3`. Only after the third dash should it transition to `IDLE`.

#### Corrected Code:

Replace the `O_DASH` state handling code with the following logic:

```verilog
O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH2;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH3;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= IDLE;
        counter <= 0;
        morse_out <= 0;
    end
end
```

### Explanation:

- **Transition through Dashes**: Each state (`O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, `O_DASH3`) correctly waits for the DASH period and then transitions to the next state.
- **Final Transition to IDLE**: After the final dash (`O_DASH3`), it transitions back to `IDLE`, at which point `morse_out` should also be reset to 0.

Implement these changes, and you should now see the Morse output for 'O' correctly simulated as "---".
