The error message "ERROR: Morse for O not correct." is occurring because the `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` states are not defined correctly in the `case` statement. These states are declared in the `localparam` section but are not properly handled within the `case (state)` statement causing the module to not correctly traverse through the O character's morse code sequence.

To fix this issue, you should modify the code in the `case (state)` statement to properly handle the `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` states. You need to adjust the transitions and behaviors in these states to correctly represent the morse code sequence for the letter O.

Here is an example of how the relevant section of the `case (state)` statement could be modified to address this issue:

```verilog
O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH2;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH3;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
        counter <= 0;
        morse_out <= 0;
    end
end
```

By adjusting the state transitions and handling the `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` states correctly within the `case (state)` statement, you should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that the Morse code for the letter O is generated correctly during simulation.
