The error message "ERROR: Morse for O not correct." indicates that there is an issue with generating the Morse code for the letter 'O' in the simulation. Looking at the `morse_code` module, the state transition for the letter 'O' is handled by states `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3`, but the behavior in these states does not differentiate between them, leading to possible confusion and incorrect code generation during simulation.

To fix this issue, you need to update the state transitions and behavior within the `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` states to correctly implement the Morse code for the letter 'O'. Ensure that the timing and transitions in these states align with the Morse code sequence for 'O' (---).

Additionally, it is important to verify the timing and transitions for all states representing the Morse code sequences to ensure correct functionality during simulation and correct Morse code generation.

By refining the state transitions and behavior specific to each Morse code sequence, the issue with generating Morse code for the letter 'O' should be resolved in the simulation.

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).
