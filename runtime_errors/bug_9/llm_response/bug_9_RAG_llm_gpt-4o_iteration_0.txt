The error message "ERROR: Morse for O not correct." suggests that the code for the Morse letter "O" (which is "---" or three dashes) is not being generated correctly in the simulation. Let's analyze the potential issue within the given code.

### Problem Analysis

1. **State Transitions for 'O':**
   - In the provided code, the states `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` are intended to represent each of the three dashes that form the Morse code for "O" (`---`).
   - Each of these dashes needs to maintain the output `morse_out` high for `DASH` cycles.

2. **State Transition Logic:**
   - When in state `O_DASH1`, after the `DASH` cycles, the state should transition to `O_DASH2`.
   - When in state `O_DASH2`, after the `DASH` cycles, the state should transition to `O_DASH3`.
   - Finally, from `O_DASH3`, after another `DASH` cycles, it should transition back to `IDLE`.

3. **Issue in the Code:**
   - Inside the `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` state handling sections, there's no logic for transitioning between these states. The existing code directly resets to `IDLE` after each `DASH`, thus failing to maintain the three consecutive dashes needed for "O".

### Solution

To fix the issue, you need to add appropriate state transitions between `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3`. Here's how you can update the `always` block to fix the issue:

```verilog
...
                O_DASH1: begin
                    morse_out <= 1;
                    if (counter < DASH) begin
                        counter <= counter + 1;
                    end else begin
                        state <= O_DASH2;  // Transition to the next dash
                        counter <= 0;
                    end
                end
                O_DASH2: begin
                    morse_out <= 1;
                    if (counter < DASH) begin
                        counter <= counter + 1;
                    end else begin
                        state <= O_DASH3;  // Transition to the last dash
                        counter <= 0;
                    end
                end
                O_DASH3: begin
                    morse_out <= 1;
                    if (counter < DASH) begin
                        counter <= counter + 1;
                    end else begin
                        state <= IDLE;  // Finally reset to IDLE
                        counter <= 0;
                        morse_out <= 0;
                    end
                end
...
```

### Explanation of the Fix

By sequentially moving through `O_DASH1` to `O_DASH3`, you ensure that the output `morse_out` remains high for three contiguous `DASH` intervals, thereby correctly generating the Morse code for "O". This solves the error in the test bench since each dash is properly accounted for before transitioning states.
