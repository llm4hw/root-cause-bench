The problem is that the state‐machine for letter O is written to “collapse” all three dashes into one state rather than stepping through the three separate − signals. In the code the branch

  O_DASH1, O_DASH2, O_DASH3: begin
   morse_out <= 1;
   if (counter < DASH) begin
    counter <= counter + 1;
   end else begin
    state <= IDLE;
    counter <= 0;
    morse_out <= 0;
   end
  end

treats every dash the same way. That means that after the first dash the circuit resets (goes to IDLE) rather than sequencing from O_DASH1 to O_DASH2 to O_DASH3. The test bench is then “seeing” an incomplete Morse code for O (only one dash rather than three) and reporting “ERROR: Morse for O not correct.”

To fix it you need to separate the three dashes so that once the counter reaches DASH in O_DASH1 the state transitions to O_DASH2, then from O_DASH2 to O_DASH3, and finally from O_DASH3 to IDLE. For example, you could split the state cases as follows:

  O_DASH1: begin
   morse_out <= 1;
   if (counter < DASH) 
    counter <= counter + 1;
   else begin
    counter <= 0;
    state <= O_DASH2;
   end
  end

  O_DASH2: begin
   morse_out <= 1;
   if (counter < DASH) 
    counter <= counter + 1;
   else begin
    counter <= 0;
    state <= O_DASH3;
   end
  end

  O_DASH3: begin
   morse_out <= 1;
   if (counter < DASH) 
    counter <= counter + 1;
   else begin
    counter <= 0;
    state <= IDLE;  // sequence complete
    morse_out <= 0;
   end
  end

This way, each dash is processed in its own state and the letter O is output as “---” as expected. That is the root cause and the needed fix.
