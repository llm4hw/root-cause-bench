The problem is that the state machine for the letter O never runs through three dashes as intended. The “O” sequence should consist of three separate dash outputs (with appropriate inter-dash spacing), but the state handling for O groups all three states (O_DASH1, O_DASH2, O_DASH3) into one process. When the counter finishes counting for one dash, the code immediately resets the state to IDLE rather than transitioning to the next dash state. As a result, only one dash period is generated, and the output stays high (or transitions incorrectly) rather than following the expected three-dash pattern. 

This mismatch in the sequence causes the test bench’s check (which waits for the output to be low after completion) to fail and produce the error “Morse for O not correct.” In other words, the design “drops” the extra dashes that should have been part of the letter O’s morse code, so the final state is not correctly reached. 

To fix the bug conceptually, the state machine’s transitions for the letter O need to be rearranged so that after the first dash period, it advances to the second dash state, then to the third, and only then returns to the idle state. This properly sequences the three dashes as required by the Morse code for O.
