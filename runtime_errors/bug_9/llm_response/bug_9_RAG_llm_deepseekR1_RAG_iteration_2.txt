The bug causing the "ERROR: Morse for O not correct" is due to the state machine not properly sequencing through the three dashes required for the 'O' character. Each dash state (O_DASH1, O_DASH2, O_DASH3) transitions back to IDLE immediately after completing a dash instead of moving to the next dash state after a space. Additionally, the SPACE_STATE handling incorrectly checks the current state instead of tracking the previous state to determine the next transition.

**Root Cause:**
- **Incorrect State Transitions for 'O':** The grouped handling of O_DASH states transitions directly to IDLE after each dash, resulting in only one dash instead of three.
- **SPACE_STATE Logic Flaw:** The SPACE_STATE checks the current state (which is always SPACE_STATE) instead of tracking which state led to the space, preventing proper sequencing.

**Fix:**
1. **Introduce a `next_state` register** to track the state to enter after the space.
2. **Modify Each O_DASH State** to transition to SPACE_STATE and set `next_state` to the subsequent dash state or IDLE.
3. **Update SPACE_STATE Handling** to transition to `next_state` after the space duration.

**Corrected Code Snippets:**
```verilog
reg [3:0] next_state; // Add this register

// Inside the always block's case statement:
A_DOT: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DOT) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state <= A_DASH; // Set next state after space
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end

O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state <= O_DASH2; // Transition to next dash after space
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end

O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state <= O_DASH3; // Transition to next dash after space
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end

O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state <= IDLE; // After third dash, go to IDLE
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end

SPACE_STATE: begin
    morse_out <= 0;
    if (counter < SPACE) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        state <= next_state; // Use next_state to determine transition
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- **next_state Register:** Tracks the intended state after the space completes.
- **O_DASH State Transitions:** Each dash state now transitions to SPACE_STATE and sets `next_state` to the next dash or IDLE, ensuring three dashes for 'O'.
- **SPACE_STATE Update:** Uses `next_state` to correctly sequence states, enabling proper transitions between dashes and other elements.

This fix ensures the 'O' character generates three dashes with appropriate spacing, resolving the simulation error.
