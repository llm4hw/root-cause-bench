The bug in the provided code occurs in the `morse_code` module in the state transition from `A_DOT` to `A_DASH`. 

In the `case` statement under state `IDLE`, when `select` is `2'b00` (representing the letter A), it correctly transitions to `A_DOT`. However, in the `case` statement for `A_DOT`, the state transition should be to `A_DASH` after the duration of `DOT` is reached, but the `A_DASH` state is not accounted for; instead, it incorrectly transitions back to `IDLE`.

To fix this bug, you should update the state transition from `A_DOT` to `A_DASH` within the `case` statement in the `morse_code` module:

```verilog
A_DOT: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DOT) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        state <= A_DASH; // Change the state transition to A_DASH here
        morse_out <= 0;
    end
end
```

By making this change, the state machine will correctly transition from `A_DOT` to `A_DASH` after the duration of `DOT` is reached, resolving the bug.
