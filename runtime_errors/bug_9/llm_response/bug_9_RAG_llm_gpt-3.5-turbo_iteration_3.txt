The bug in the code is in the `case (state)` section of the state machine. Specifically, there is an issue in the handling of the transitions related to the letter O (`O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, `O_DASH3`). The issue is that once the state "O_DASH1" is entered, there is no transition to the subsequent O_DASH states or back to the IDLE state, which is causing the Morse for O to not be generated correctly.

To fix this bug, you need to update the transitions for the O states to properly handle the sequence for generating the Morse code for the letter O. Below is an updated version of the `case (state)` section with corrected transitions:

```verilog
O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH2;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH3;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
        counter <= 0;
        morse_out <= 0;
    end
end
```

With these corrections, the state machine will properly transition through the O_DASH states to generate the Morse code for the letter O as expected.

By making these changes, the issue should be resolved, and the Morse for O should be generated correctly during simulation.
