The bug causing the error message "ERROR: Morse for O not correct" is in the testbench code. Specifically, in the section testing for the Morse code of 'O' (select = 2'b01), the reset signal is being toggled after setting the select signal. This effectively resets the module just before the Morse code for 'O' is generated, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, you need to adjust the timing in the testbench for the 'O' test case to not reset the module just after setting the select signal. By removing the unnecessary reset toggling after setting the select signal for 'O', the testbench will allow the module to generate the Morse code for 'O' correctly. 

Here's the corrected section of the testbench code for testing Morse code for 'O':
```Verilog
// Test 'O' -> ---
#10 select = 2'b01;
#150;  // Wait for DOT and DASH
if (!morse_out) begin
    $display("Morse for O generated correctly.");
end else begin
    $display("ERROR: Morse for O not correct.");
    $fatal;
end
```

By making this adjustment to the testbench code, the simulation should now correctly assess the Morse code generation for 'O'.

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).
