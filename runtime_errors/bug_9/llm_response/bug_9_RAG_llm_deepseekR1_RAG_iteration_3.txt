The bug causing the "ERROR: Morse for O not correct" is due to the `O_DASH` states not properly progressing through three dashes and lacking necessary spaces between them. 

**Why it's occurring:**
- **Incorrect State Transitions for 'O':** The code groups all `O_DASH` states (1, 2, 3) together. After each dash, it transitions directly to `IDLE` instead of moving to the next dash state. This results in only one dash being sent instead of three.
- **Faulty SPACE_STATE Handling:** The `SPACE_STATE` doesn't track which state led to it, causing incorrect transitions. For example, after a dash in `O_DASH1`, there's no space or progression to `O_DASH2`.

**Fix the code by:**
1. **Adding a `next_state` register** to track the state following `SPACE_STATE`.
2. **Modifying state transitions** to use `SPACE_STATE` between dashes and update `next_state` appropriately.

**Corrected Code Snippets:**

1. **Add `next_state` register:**
```verilog
reg [3:0] next_state;
```

2. **Update `O_DASH` and `SPACE_STATE` handling:**
```verilog
// Inside the case statement for each state:
O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state <= O_DASH2; // Next dash after space
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end
O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state <= O_DASH3; // Next dash after space
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end
O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state <= IDLE; // Final state after third dash
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end
SPACE_STATE: begin
    morse_out <= 0;
    if (counter < SPACE) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        state <= next_state; // Transition to the tracked next state
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- Each `O_DASH` state now transitions to `SPACE_STATE` and sets `next_state` to the subsequent dash or `IDLE`.
- `SPACE_STATE` uses `next_state` to resume the correct sequence, inserting a space between dashes and ensuring three dashes are sent for 'O'.

This ensures the Morse code for 'O' (---) is generated correctly with proper timing and transitions, resolving the testbench error.
