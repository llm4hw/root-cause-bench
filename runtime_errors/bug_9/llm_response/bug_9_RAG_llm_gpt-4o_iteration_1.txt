The error message "ERROR: Morse for O not correct" occurs because the "O" morse code sequence is not being generated correctly in the provided Verilog module. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to fix it:

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Morse Code for 'O':**
   - Morse code for 'O' is represented by three dashes (---).
   - Each dash should be generated sequentially.
   
2. **State Machine for 'O':**
   - In the code, states `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` are intended to produce the three consecutive dashes.
   - The current implementation fails to chain these states. After completing `O_DASH1`, it directly resets the state to `IDLE` without transitioning through `O_DASH2` and `O_DASH3`.

3. **Error in State Transitions:**
   - All the `O_DASH` states have the same implementation: after one `DASH` duration, they return to `IDLE`.
   - This means only one dash is being produced instead of three.

### Solution:

To correct the state machine for 'O', you need to properly sequence through the three `O_DASH` states to produce three dashes:

1. **Modify State Transitions for 'O':**
   - Ensure that after completing `O_DASH1`, the state transitions to `O_DASH2`, and after `O_DASH2` transitions to `O_DASH3`.
   - After completing `O_DASH3`, transition back to `IDLE`.

### Code Fix:

Modify the `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` state handling as follows:

```verilog
O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH2;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH3;
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= IDLE;
        counter <= 0;
        morse_out <= 0;
    end
end
```

By implementing these state transitions correctly, the code will generate the correct Morse sequence for 'O', and you should no longer encounter the "Morse for O not correct" error in the testbench.
