The error message "ERROR: Morse for O not correct." is generated by the failing testbench check for the Morse code generation of the letter 'O', which is expected to be represented by three consecutive dashes (---). Let's break down the potential issue and fix it.

### Analysis of the Problem:

1. **State Transition for 'O':**
   - The states for generating 'O' are `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3`. For each of these states, the output should be a dash, lasting for a duration defined by `DASH`.
   - However, in the current implementation, each of these states (`O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, `O_DASH3`) transitions immediately back to `IDLE` after completing a single dash, instead of proceeding to the next dash.

2. **Error in State Transition Logic:**
   - The logic for transitioning between the dash generation states for 'O' is incorrect. The state should transition from `O_DASH1` to `O_DASH2`, and then `O_DASH2` to `O_DASH3`, before returning to `IDLE`.

### Proposed Fix:

Modify the state transition logic for the 'O' dashes to ensure that it correctly sequences through `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, `O_DASH3` before going back to `IDLE`.

```verilog
O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH2; // Transition to the next dash
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= O_DASH3; // Transition to the third dash
        counter <= 0;
    end
end
O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        state <= IDLE; // Finally go back to idle after last dash
        counter <= 0;
        morse_out <= 0;
    end
end
```

### Explanation:

- Each dash duration is controlled by the `counter`. Once the count for a dash is complete, the state should transition to the next dash state (`O_DASH2` and `O_DASH3`) instead of reverting to `IDLE`.
- After three dashes are generated, the FSM transitions back to `IDLE`.

Once this fix is applied, the state machine should correctly output the three consecutive dashes for the letter 'O'. Retesting with the corrected state transition should pass the testbench checks for 'O'.
