The bug causing the "ERROR: Morse for O not correct" is due to the `O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, and `O_DASH3` states being grouped together, causing only a single dash to be generated instead of three. Each O_DASH state transitions directly to `IDLE` after completing its dash, skipping subsequent dashes and spaces. Additionally, the `SPACE_STATE` logic incorrectly transitions to `IDLE` instead of the next O_DASH state.

**Fix:**
1. **Separate O_DASH States:** Handle each O_DASH state (`O_DASH1`, `O_DASH2`, `O_DASH3`) individually to transition to the next state via `SPACE_STATE`.
2. **Track Next State After Space:** Introduce a register (`next_state_after_space`) to determine the correct state after the space completes.

**Modified Code Snippets:**

1. **Add a register to track the next state:**
```verilog
reg [3:0] next_state_after_space;
```

2. **Update O_DASH states to transition to SPACE_STATE and set the next state:**
```verilog
O_DASH1: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state_after_space <= O_DASH2; // Next dash after space
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end
O_DASH2: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state_after_space <= O_DASH3; // Next dash after space
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end
O_DASH3: begin
    morse_out <= 1;
    if (counter < DASH) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        next_state_after_space <= IDLE; // Final dash, return to IDLE
        state <= SPACE_STATE;
    end
end
```

3. **Modify SPACE_STATE to use the tracked next state:**
```verilog
SPACE_STATE: begin
    morse_out <= 0;
    if (counter < SPACE) begin
        counter <= counter + 1;
    end else begin
        counter <= 0;
        state <= next_state_after_space; // Transition to the tracked state
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- **Problem:** The original code grouped all O_DASH states, transitioning to `IDLE` after the first dash, resulting in only one dash for 'O'.
- **Solution:** Each O_DASH state now transitions to `SPACE_STATE`, which uses `next_state_after_space` to sequence through `O_DASH1` → `O_DASH2` → `O_DASH3` → `IDLE`, ensuring three dashes with proper spacing. This mirrors the correct behavior seen in the 'A' case, allowing the testbench to validate the full Morse sequence for 'O'.
