The bug occurs because the comparator module incorrectly checks if input `a` equals a 5-bit value (`5'b10101`) instead of comparing `a` and `b`.

**Root Cause:**
- The line `if (a == 5'b10101)` is invalid because:
  1. `a` is declared as a 4-bit input (`[3:0]`), but `5'b10101` is a 5-bit value (21 in decimal).
  2. This comparison can never be true (4-bit inputs can only represent 0-15).
  3. The module was supposed to compare `a` and `b`, but the code mistakenly checks `a` against a fixed 5-bit value.

**Fix:**
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (a == b) begin  // Compare a with b instead of fixed value
        result = 1;
    end else begin
        result = 0;
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- The original code had a hardcoded comparison to an out-of-range 5-bit value (typo/misunderstanding of the requirements).
- The fixed code properly compares the two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`, returning 1 when they are equal.
- This matches the testbench's expectation that `result = 1` when `a = b`.

**Bonus Improvement:** Use simpler assignment:
```verilog
assign result = (a == b);  // Continuous assignment instead of procedural
```
This would make the module combinational and more concise.
