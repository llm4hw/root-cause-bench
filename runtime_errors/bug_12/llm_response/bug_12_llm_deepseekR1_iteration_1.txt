The bug arises because the comparator module does not actually compare inputs `a` and `b`. Instead, it erroneously checks if `a` equals the 5-bit literal `5'b10101` (decimal 21), which is impossible since `a` is declared as 4 bits (max value 15). This causes `result` to always be 0, failing the test case where `a = b`. The error occurs due to a mismatch in bit widths (4-bit `a` vs. 5-bit literal) and the absence of any comparison between `a` and `b` in the logic. The fix involves modifying the condition to check `a == b` instead of the invalid literal.
