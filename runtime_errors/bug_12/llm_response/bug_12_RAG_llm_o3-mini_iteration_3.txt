The bug is that the comparator is not really comparing the two inputs (a and b). Instead, it is checking if a is equal to the constant 5'b10101. This condition is never met for most normal 4‑bit values (and even if it were, the literal’s size is 5 bits, whereas a is only 4 bits), so the module always produces a zero result when a equals b. The root cause is that the designer accidentally used an incorrect literal (5'b10101) in the if‑statement rather than comparing a with b.

To fix the issue, change the if‑statement so that it compares a and b directly. For example, revise the always block as follows:

------------------------------------------------
always @(*) begin
    if (a == b) begin
        result = 1;
    end else begin
        result = 0;
    end
end
------------------------------------------------

With this change, the module will generate the correct output (result = 1 when a equals b, and result = 0 otherwise), and the test bench will pass without triggering an error.
