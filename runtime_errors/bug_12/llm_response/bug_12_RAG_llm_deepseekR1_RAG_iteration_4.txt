The bug in the `faulty_comparator` module is caused by an incorrect comparison in the logic. Here's the breakdown:

**Why it's occurring:**
1. The comparator checks `if (a == 5'b10101)` (which equals decimal 21)
2. Inputs `a` and `b` are defined as 4-bit values (range 0-15)
3. The comparison can never be true (21 > 15), so `result` is always 0
4. The test case `a = 4'd9; b = 4'd9` fails because the design isn't comparing `a` and `b`

**Fix:**
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (a == b) begin  // Changed from 5'b10101 to actual comparison
        result = 1;
    end else begin
        result = 0;
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- The original code was comparing against a fixed 5-bit value instead of input `b`
- The corrected version properly compares the two 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`
- This matches the intended functionality of setting `result=1` when inputs are equal

This fix addresses the root cause by implementing the actual comparison between the two inputs rather than checking against an unreachable constant value.
