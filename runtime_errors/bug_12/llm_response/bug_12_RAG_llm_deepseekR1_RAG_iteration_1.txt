The bug is in the faulty_comparator module's comparison logic. Here's the breakdown:

**What's the bug?**
The comparator incorrectly checks for `a == 5'b10101` (21 in decimal) instead of comparing `a` with `b`.

**Why is it occurring?**
1. Type mismatch: The code uses a 5-bit literal (`5'b10101`) to compare with 4-bit input `a`
2. Invalid comparison: The logic was meant to compare inputs `a` and `b`, but instead checks for a specific value (21) that's impossible to reach with 4-bit inputs (max value 15)
3. Input `b` is completely ignored in the comparison logic

**How to fix it:**
Modify the comparison in the always block to compare `a` with `b`:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (a == b) begin  // Changed from 5'b10101 to b
        result = 1;
    end else begin
        result = 0;
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- This fixes the type mismatch (4-bit vs 4-bit comparison)
- Implements the actual intended functionality of comparing input `a` with input `b`
- Allows proper equality checking as required by the test cases
- The comparator will now output 1 when inputs are equal and 0 otherwise, matching the testbench's expectations

This change addresses the root cause of the error message by implementing the correct comparison logic between the two 4-bit inputs, rather than checking for an impossible 5-bit value.
