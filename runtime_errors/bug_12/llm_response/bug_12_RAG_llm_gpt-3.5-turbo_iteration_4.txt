The bug in the code is that the faulty_comparator module is not correctly comparing the values of input a and b to determine the result. The current comparison in the faulty_comparator module is checking if the value of 'a' is equal to 5'b10101 (which translates to decimal 21), and not checking if 'a' is equal to 'b' as intended.

To fix this issue, the comparison in the faulty_comparator module should be modified to correctly check if 'a' is equal to 'b.' Here is the corrected code for the faulty_comparator module:

```verilog
module faulty_comparator (
    input [3:0] a, // 4-bit input
    input [3:0] b, // 4-bit input
    output reg result // Result of comparison
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (a == b) begin // Changed to compare a and b
            result = 1;
        end else begin
            result = 0;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

After making this change, simulate the test bench again, and the comparison should now correctly check if 'a' is equal to 'b'. This modification should resolve the error where the expected result was not being achieved during the simulation.
