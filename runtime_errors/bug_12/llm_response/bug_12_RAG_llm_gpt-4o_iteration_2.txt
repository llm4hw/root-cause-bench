The error is occurring because the logic in the `faulty_comparator` module is incorrect. The condition in the module is checking if `a` is equal to `5'b10101`, which is not a valid condition for 4-bit inputs because `5'b10101` (binary for the decimal number 21) is a 5-bit number. Therefore, this assignment does not make sense given that the inputs `a` and `b` are specified as 4-bit numbers (which can have maximum values from 0 to 15).

Here's a breakdown of why the error occurs and how to fix it:

### Root Cause:

1. **Invalid Condition Statement**: The condition `if (a == 5'b10101)` is checking if the 4-bit input `a` equals a 5-bit binary number that is not possible with a 4-bit input.

2. **Comparison Logic**: The test is designed to check if `a` is equal to `b`, but the module is comparing `a` to a constant, which does not achieve the desired comparison between `a` and `b`.

### Fix:

To fix the issue, the module should compare `a` directly to `b`:

```verilog
module comparator (
    input [3:0] a, // 4-bit input
    input [3:0] b, // 4-bit input
    output reg result // Result of comparison
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (a == b) begin
            result = 1; // Set result to 1 if a equals b
        end else begin
            result = 0; // Set result to 0 if a does not equal b
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:

1. **Correct Condition**: Change the comparison to `if (a == b)`, which checks if both 4-bit numbers are equal.
   
2. **Returning the Correct Result**: Adjust the logic so that the result is set correctly based on whether `a` equals `b`.

With these modifications, the test bench should pass without generating an error, correctly verifying the equality between `a` and `b`.
