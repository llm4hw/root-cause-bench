The bug is in the comparison condition inside the `always` block of the `faulty_comparator` module. The comparison `if (a == 5'b10101)` is looking for the value 5'b10101 in binary (which is decimal 21) in a 4-bit input. This condition will never be true with a 4-bit input of `a` and `b`. The condition should be corrected to align with the 4-bit inputs.

To fix the issue, you need to adjust the comparison condition to match with the 4-bit inputs. For example, if you want `result` to be 1 when `a` is equal to `b`, you should change the comparison to `if (a == b)`. This will fix the bug by correctly comparing the 4-bit inputs `a` and `b` for equality.

Here is the corrected code for the `faulty_comparator` module:
```verilog
module faulty_comparator (
    input [3:0] a, // 4-bit input
    input [3:0] b, // 4-bit input
    output reg result // Result of comparison
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (a == b) begin
            result = 1;
        end else begin
            result = 0;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

After making this change, simulate the test bench again to verify that the expected results are now correctly generated when comparing the 4-bit inputs `a` and `b`.
