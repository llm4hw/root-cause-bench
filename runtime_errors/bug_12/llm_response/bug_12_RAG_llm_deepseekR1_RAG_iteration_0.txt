The bug in the code arises because the comparator module is incorrectly checking if input `a` equals the 5-bit value `5'b10101` (21 in decimal) instead of comparing `a` and `b`. 

**Why it occurs:**
- The module `faulty_comparator` declares `a` and `b` as 4-bit inputs, but the condition `if (a == 5'b10101)` compares `a` to a 5-bit literal. 
- In Verilog, when operands of unequal bit-widths are compared, the shorter one is zero-padded on the left. Thus, `a` (4 bits) is treated as a 5-bit value (e.g., `4'b1001` becomes `5'b01001`), which will never equal `5'b10101` (21). 
- As a result, `result` is always `0` except when `a` is `5'b10101` (which is impossible for a 4-bit input), causing test failures when `a == b`.

**Fix:**
Modify the `if` condition to compare `a` and `b` instead of `a` and `5'b10101`:
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (a == b) begin  // Correct comparison between a and b
        result = 1;
    end else begin
        result = 0;
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**
- The corrected code checks if `a` equals `b`, setting `result` to `1` when true and `0` otherwise. This matches the intended behavior described in the test bench, resolving the error.
