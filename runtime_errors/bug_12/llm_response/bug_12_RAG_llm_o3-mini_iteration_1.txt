The bug is in the faulty_comparator module. Instead of comparing the two inputs a and b, the design mistakenly compares a to a constant value 5'b10101. This causes the module never to assert result = 1 when a equals b (unless a inadvertently equals the constant 21, which is impossible given a is only 4 bits wide). 

Why it’s occurring:
• The if-statement is written as if (a == 5'b10101) instead of comparing the two inputs.
• The constant 5'b10101 is a 5-bit number (binary 10101 equals 21), which is out of range for the 4-bit input a.
• As a consequence, even when a equals b (as expected by the test bench), the condition fails, and result is assigned 0 instead of 1.

How to fix it:
Modify the if-statement to properly compare the two inputs. For example, change the code to:

-------------------------------------------------
module fixed_comparator (
    input [3:0] a,          // 4-bit input
    input [3:0] b,          // 4-bit input
    output reg result       // Result of comparison
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (a == b) begin
            result = 1;
        end else begin
            result = 0;
        end
    end
endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

This change will ensure that result is set to 1 when a equals b, which will satisfy the requirements of the test bench.
