The issue with the `faulty_comparator` code lies in how the `result` is set based on the conditions given in the `always` block. Specifically, the line `if (a == 5'b10101)` is problematic because it is checking whether `a` is equal to an invalid 5-bit binary representation, `10101`, while `a` and `b` are both defined as 4-bit inputs. The comparison `a == b` is intended to check if `a` is equal to `b`, but the current implementation disregards `b` altogether and checks `a` against a constant 5-bit binary value.

### Root Cause:
1. The code uses a 5-bit binary constant `5'b10101` inside the `always` block, which is not a valid comparison for a 4-bit input. This will never evaluate to true given the test inputs.
2. The logic needed to compare `a` and `b` values is completely missing. 

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the code, modify the `faulty_comparator` to compare the values of `a` and `b` to determine equality. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module fixed_comparator (
    input [3:0] a, // 4-bit input
    input [3:0] b, // 4-bit input
    output reg result // Result of comparison
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (a == b) begin
            result = 1;
        end else begin
            result = 0;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The `always` block inside `fixed_comparator` now checks if `a` is equal to `b` using `if (a == b)`.
- It sets `result` to `1` if `a` equals `b`, fulfilling the expectation that `result` should be `1` when the inputs are equal.
- Otherwise, it sets `result` to `0` when the inputs are not equal.

Replace the instantiation of `faulty_comparator` with `fixed_comparator` in the testbench and it should run as expected without errors.
