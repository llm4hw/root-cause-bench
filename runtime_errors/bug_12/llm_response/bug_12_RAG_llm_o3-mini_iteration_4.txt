The bug is in the always block of the faulty_comparator module. Instead of comparing the two inputs a and b, the code is mistakenly comparing a to a constant value, 5'b10101. In other words, the code checks:

  if (a == 5'b10101)

when it should be checking if a is equal to b. Moreover, a is declared as a 4-bit value, but the constant is a 5-bit binary number, which adds to the mismatch.

This bug causes the condition never to be true unless a somehow (erroneously) matches a 5-bit constant, so even when a equals b, the result remains 0. The test bench expects result to be 1 when a equals b, hence the error message.

To fix the issue, change the condition to compare a with b:

  if (a == b) begin
   result = 1;
  end else begin
   result = 0;
  end

After applying this change, the comparator behaves correctly, and the test bench should report that all test cases pass.
