The bug in the code is in the comparison condition in the `faulty_comparator` module. The condition `if (a == 5'b10101)` is checking if input `a` is equal to binary 10101, which is decimal 21, not 9 as intended in the testbench. Hence, the result is not being set correctly for the test cases. 

To fix this bug, the comparison condition should be changed to `if (a == 4'd9)` to correctly compare the 4-bit input `a` with decimal 9 as intended in the testbench.

Here is the corrected code snippet for the `faulty_comparator` module:
```verilog
module faulty_comparator (
    input [3:0] a, // 4-bit input
    input [3:0] b, // 4-bit input
    output reg result // Result of comparison
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (a == 4'd9) begin
            result = 1;
        end else begin
            result = 0;
        end
    end
endmodule
```
After making this change, the test cases should pass without any errors.
