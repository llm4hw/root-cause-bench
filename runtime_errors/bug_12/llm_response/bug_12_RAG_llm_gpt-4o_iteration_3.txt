The error in the test bench arises due to the faulty logic in the `faulty_comparator` module. Let's break down the points of failure:

1. **Issue with Input Width:**
   - In the module `faulty_comparator`, the comparison `if (a == 5'b10101)` is checking if the input `a` is equal to a 5-bit number. However, both inputs `a` and `b` are declared as 4-bit values, and `5'b10101` is a 5-bit number which equals `21` in decimal.

2. **Logical Error:**
   - The module receives two 4-bit inputs, `a` and `b`, and is expected to output `1` when `a == b`. But the existing conditional check only assigns `1` to `result` if `a` is equal to `21`, which is impossible with a 4-bit number since the maximum value for a 4-bit binary number is `2^4 - 1 = 15`.

3. **Fix:**
   - You should modify the conditional check in the `always` block of the module to correctly compare the equivalence of inputs `a` and `b`. Below is the corrected version of the module:

  ```verilog
    module faulty_comparator (
        input [3:0] a, // 4-bit input
        input [3:0] b, // 4-bit input
        output reg result // Result of comparison
    );
        always @(*) begin
            if (a == b) begin
                result = 1;
            end else begin
                result = 0;
            end
        end
    endmodule
  ```

This correction makes the module correctly set `result = 1` when `a` equals `b`, and `result = 0` otherwise, fitting the test bench's expectations. After implementing these changes, the test bench should pass all cases without errors.
