The bug in the code is in the `always @(*)` block of the `faulty_comparator` module. The comparison condition `if (a == 5'b10101)` aims to check if input `a` is equal to the binary number 10101 in 5 bits. However, in the Verilog code, `5'b10101` is defined as a 5-bit binary number, which is equivalent to the decimal value 21, not 10101 in binary.

To fix this bug, you need to correct the comparison condition in the `always @(*)` block to check for the correct binary value. In this case, if you intend to compare `a` with the binary value 10101 in 5 bits, you should use `5'b10101` correctly. If you want to compare `a` with the binary value of 10101 in 4 bits, you should use `4'b1010`. Ensure that the comparison in the `always @(*)` block matches the intended binary value correctly.
