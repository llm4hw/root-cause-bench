The error you're encountering stems from the fact that the functionality expected by the testbench does not align with the functionality implemented in the `faulty_comparator` module. Let's break down why this is occurring:

1. **Code Implementation Misalignment**: The testbench assumes that the `result` should be 1 whenever `a` is equal to `b`, which means the intended functionality is to compare the equality of `a` and `b`. However, the actual implementation in the `faulty_comparator` checks if `a` is equal to a fixed 5-bit value (`5'b10101`), which is incorrect for several reasons:
   - `a` is a 4-bit register, but the code is comparing it with a 5-bit value (`5'b10101`, or 21 in decimal). This miscomparison means the comparison is practically always false because the bit-widths are different, and 21 can't be represented as a 4-bit number.
   - The implementation logic doesn't involve `b` at all, even though the testbench expects the output to depend on the comparison between `a` and `b`.

2. **Testbench Debugging Analysis**:
   - **Expected Behavior**: Whenever `a == b`, the testbench expects the `result` to be 1. Conversely, if `a` is not equal to `b`, `result` should be 0.
   - **Actual Behavior**: The `result` is set to 1 only when `a` is exactly `21` (incorrect comparison) regardless of `b`. `result` is set to 0 in all other cases.

3. **Why the Error Occurs**:
   - During simulation, none of the cases set by the testbench for `a` (range from 0 to 15, as `a` is 4-bit) will satisfy the current condition `a == 5'b10101` and hence `result` is always 0 when `a` does not equal 21. This leads to failed test cases whenever the condition `a == b` is met according to the testbench rules.

4. **Reason Behind Expected vs Actual Output**: When the testbench sets `a` = `b` (e.g., both being 9 or both being 15), the expected behavior according to the testbench—the `result` being 1—is not achieved because the comparator logic does not evaluate `a == b` at all.

In summary, the root cause of the issue is that the `faulty_comparator` logic does not match the presumed equality comparison functionality expected by the testbench. Instead, it checks for equality against a specific multi-bit constant which is incorrect both theoretically (comparing 4-bit with 5-bit) and practically (checks for an out-of-range value).

To resolve this, the logic within the `faulty_comparator` should be revised to properly compare `a` and `b` directly, ensuring the module behavior agrees with the intended testbench assumptions of equality comparison.
