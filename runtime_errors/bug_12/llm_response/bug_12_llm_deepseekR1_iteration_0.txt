The bug occurs because the design does not compare inputs `a` and `b` at all. Instead, it erroneously checks if the 4-bit `a` equals the 5-bit literal `5'b10101` (decimal 21), which is impossible since `a` can only hold values 0-15. The `result` is always 0, failing all test cases where `a == b`. The root cause is that the comparator logic ignores input `b` and uses an invalid comparison value for `a`. The fix involves modifying the condition to check equality between `a` and `b` instead of the hardcoded 5-bit value.
