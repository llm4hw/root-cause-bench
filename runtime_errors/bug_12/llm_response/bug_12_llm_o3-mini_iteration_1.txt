The bug stems from using an incorrect condition in the always block. Instead of comparing the two input signals, the code compares one of them to a literal 5-bit constant, which is both the wrong value and a mismatched bit width compared to the 4-bit input. This causes the simulation to never meet the intended condition when a equals b, triggering the error message from the test bench.

Specifically, the module incorrectly checks if a equals a 5-bit constant (representing the value 21 in decimal) rather than comparing a to b. Since the test bench expects the result to be 1 when a and b are equal (such as when both are 9 or both are 15), the condition fails. Moreover, even if a were meant to be compared to some constant, comparing a 4-bit input to a 5-bit literal is problematic and likely unintended.

The fix involves correcting the comparison so that the two inputs (a and b) are compared directly. This resolves both the logical error in the condition and the bit-width mismatch.
