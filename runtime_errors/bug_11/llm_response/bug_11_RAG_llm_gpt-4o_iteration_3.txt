The issue in the FSM code and testbench arises due to the lack of conditions that handle cases when `num_in` is out of the valid range (i.e., not between 0 and 9, inclusive). In the provided FSM, all `num_in` values are directly assigned to the state without any validation, and `valid` is set to `1` regardless of the input.

### Root Cause:
1. **No Validation**: The `num_in` is assigned to `state`, and `valid` is set to 1 without checking if `num_in` is between 0 and 9. Therefore, when `num_in` exceeds 9 (like `10` or `15`), it still updates the FSM state and incorrectly sets `valid` to `1`.

2. **Missing Default Case Handling**: The FSM does not check for invalid states and set the output accordingly. Without this check, it assumes all inputs (`num_in`) are valid.

### Fix:
Add a condition in the FSM that verifies if the `num_in` value is within the acceptable range (0-9) before updating the state and setting `valid` to `1`. Set `valid` to `0` whenever `num_in` is out of range.

Here's how the main issue can be fixed in the FSM logic:

```verilog
// Update the FSM sequential logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= S0; // Default state on reset
        output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
        valid <= 0; // Default invalid
    end else begin
        // Validate range of num_in
        if (num_in <= 4'd9) begin
            state <= num_in; // Update the state if num_in is valid
            valid <= 1; // Set valid to true if num_in is within range
        end else begin
            state <= S0; // Default or error state
            valid <= 0; // Set valid to false if num_in is out of range
            output_data <= 8'd0; // Set default output for invalid input
        end
    end
end
```

By including these changes, the FSM will only consider inputs between 0 and 9 as valid, and it will behave as expected in the test cases where `num_in` is outside that range. The testbench will no longer produce the error as it will detect invalid `num_in` values correctly and handle them by ensuring `valid` is set to `0` and `output_data` is set appropriately.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
