The bug is that the FSM does not check whether the input is in the valid range ('0'–'9'). In the sequential always block, the design simply sets

  state <= num_in;
  valid <= 1;

so that even when a value like 10 or 15 is applied, the FSM still flags the output as valid. The testbench, however, expects out‐of-range inputs to yield valid = 0 and an output_data of 0.

To fix this, you need to add a check so that if num_in is greater than 9, the FSM sets valid to 0 and (optionally) the output data to a default value. For example, you can modify the always block as follows:

  always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
   if (reset) begin
    state <= S0;
    output_data <= 8'd0;
    valid <= 0;
   end else if (num_in <= 4'd9) begin
    state <= num_in;
    valid <= 1;
   end else begin
    state <= S0; // or any default state management
    valid <= 0;
    output_data <= 8'd0;
   end
  end

This way, when invalid input (e.g., 10 or 15) is provided, valid is correctly set to 0 and the output data is zero, satisfying the testbench requirements.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
