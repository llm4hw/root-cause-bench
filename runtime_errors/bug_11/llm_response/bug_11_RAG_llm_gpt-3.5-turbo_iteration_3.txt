The error message "ERROR: Invalid input should not be valid" is occurring because the test bench is checking for `valid` to be 0 when the input value is invalid (greater than 9), but it is not getting the expected value. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the `valid` signal in the design logic is not properly updated when an invalid input is detected.

To fix this issue, you should update the design logic to properly handle the case when the input is invalid (greater than 9) to set `valid` to 0. You can modify the `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block in the design module by adding a conditional check to set `valid` to 0 when the input is out of range. Here is an example of how you can update the code snippet inside the `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block to handle the invalid input case:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= S0; // Default state on reset
        output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
        valid <= 0; // Default invalid
    end else begin
        if (num_in > 9) begin
            valid <= 0; // Set valid to 0 for invalid inputs
        end else begin
            state <= num_in;
            valid <= 1; // Set valid to 1 for valid inputs
        end
    end
end
```

By making this modification, the `valid` signal will be correctly updated based on the input value, ensuring that the test bench will pass the expected checks for valid and invalid inputs.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
