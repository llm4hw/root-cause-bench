The bug is that the `valid` signal is always set to 1 in non-reset cycles, even for invalid inputs like `num_in = 10` or `15`. This causes the testbench to fail when checking invalid inputs.

**Why it occurs:**
In the sequential block:
```verilog
else begin
    state <= num_in;
    valid <= 1; // <-- Bug: Unconditionally sets valid=1
end
```
The `valid` signal is hard-coded to 1 whenever the FSM is not in reset, regardless of `num_in`'s value.

**Fix:**
Modify the `valid` assignment to check if `num_in` is within 0-9:
```verilog
else begin
    state <= num_in;
    valid <= (num_in <= 4'd9) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0; // Check validity
end
```

**Explanation:**
- `valid` now depends on `num_in` being ≤ 9 (4-bit binary values 0-9)
- Invalid inputs like 10-15 will set `valid = 0`
- Matches the testbench's expectation that invalid inputs should not be valid

This ensures `valid` correctly reflects whether the input is in the allowed range (0-9), fixing the testbench error.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
