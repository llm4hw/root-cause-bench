The bug occurs because the FSM does not validate the `num_in` input before updating the `valid` signal. In the sequential block, `valid` is unconditionally set to 1 whenever `reset` is low, even for invalid inputs (like `num_in = 4'd10` or `4'd15`). The `valid` signal should only be 1 when `num_in` is within 0-9. Additionally, when `num_in` is invalid, the FSM transitions to an undefined state (since the state directly copies `num_in`), and the combinational block lacks a `default` case to handle invalid states, causing `output_data` to retain stale values instead of resetting to 0. To fix this, add a condition to set `valid` based on `num_in` validity, and handle invalid states in the combinational block.
