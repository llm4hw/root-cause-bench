The bug in the code is likely occurring due to the incorrect comparison being made in the test bench for the validity of the input. 

When the `num_in` value exceeds the allowed range (i.e., when it is greater than 9), the `valid` signal is not being correctly set to 0 in the RTL code. Instead, it is using the last valid `state` value which may lead to an incorrect valid signal.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement in the FSM sequential logic that sets the `valid` signal should be modified to properly handle the case when the input `num_in` is out of the valid range (0 to 9). This will ensure that the `valid` signal is correctly set to 0 when an invalid input is detected. 

Additionally, the test bench should check for the correct behavior regarding the `valid` signal when an invalid input is provided and ensure that the output is what is expected for such inputs. 

Making these adjustments in both the RTL code and the test bench should address the issue and lead to the proper functioning of the design.
