The bug occurs because the `valid` signal is unconditionally set to 1 whenever `reset` is not active, regardless of whether `num_in` is within the valid range (0-9). In the sequential logic block, the code directly assigns `state <= num_in` and `valid <= 1` without checking if `num_in` is a valid input (0-9). This causes `valid` to be incorrectly asserted even for invalid inputs like 10 or 15. Additionally, the output logic does not handle invalid states (e.g., `state` values outside S0-S9), leading to unexpected `output_data` retention instead of resetting to 0.

**Root Cause:**  
- The `valid` signal is not gated by a check on `num_in`. Any non-reset cycle forces `valid` to 1, violating the requirement that it should only be high for valid inputs (0-9).  
- Invalid `num_in` values (e.g., 10-15) are allowed to update `state`, leading to undefined state behavior.  
- The combinational block for `output_data` lacks a `default` case to handle invalid states, causing it to retain old values instead of resetting to 0.  

**Fix Strategy:**  
1. **Conditional Validation:** In the sequential block, set `valid` to 1 *only* when `num_in` is between 0-9. For invalid inputs, set `valid` to 0.  
2. **State Update Logic:** Prevent invalid `num_in` values from updating `state` (e.g., keep the state unchanged or reset it).  
3. **Default Output Handling:** Add a `default` clause in the combinational `case` statements to force `output_data` to 0 when the state is invalid.
