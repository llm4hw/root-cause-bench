The bug originates from the FSM implementation in the `fsm_mealy_0_to_9` module. The critical issue is that the FSM only sets the `state` and `valid` signals based directly on the `num_in` input without checking for input validity. The Verilog code always assigns `num_in` to the `state` and sets `valid` to high (1), regardless of whether the input value is a valid digit (0 through 9).

### Why the Bug Occurs:
1. **Unconditional State Assignment**: In the sequential logic inside the `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block, the `state` is assigned directly from `num_in`. This means any value of `num_in` from 0 to 15 gets mapped directly to the state, regardless of validity.
   
2. **Unconditional Valid Signal**: The `valid` signal is set to high (1) for any value of `num_in`. There's no logic that checks if `num_in` falls outside the valid range (0 to 9) and, as a result, it doesn't go low (0) for invalid values of the input.

3. **Lack of Default Case**: In the `always @(state)` block for setting `output_data`, no cases are defined for when `state` should be invalid or behavior for states `S10` to `S15`. These states are assigned when `num_in` is in the range of 10 to 15.

### Explanation of the Error:
The testbench is designed to expect that the `valid` signal becomes low (0) when an invalid number is input (e.g., when `num_in` is 10 or 15, which are outside the expected 0-9 range). Similarly, for invalid inputs, the `output_data` is expected to be 0. However, because `valid` is always set to 1 and there's no default handling for outputs linked to invalid states, it causes the testbench to fail due to unmet expectations.

### How to Fix It:
To resolve the error and ensure proper functioning, implement the following:
- **Add Input Validation**: Modify the FSM sequential logic to set `valid` to 1 only when `num_in` is within the correct range (0 to 9). If `num_in` is not in the valid range, `valid` should be 0, and the `state` should not be affected.
  
- **Default State Behavior**: Include a default case or extend the case statements in the `always @(state)` block to handle states outside the 0 to 9 range (either explicitly or by ensuring output defaults such as 0).

By implementing these changes, the FSM will correctly manage valid and invalid inputs as expected by the testbench, allowing the simulation to pass without errors.
