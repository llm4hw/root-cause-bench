The bug in the testbench code occurs because the comparison operator used is `!==` which is not a valid syntax. The correct syntax for inequality comparison in Verilog is `!=`. 

To fix the bug, the following lines in the testbench need to be updated:
- Change `if (output_data !== 8'd5)` to `if (output_data != 8'd5)`
- Change `if (valid !== 0)` to `if (valid != 0)`
- Change `if (output_data !== 8'd0)` to `if (output_data != 8'd0)`

By making these corrections, the testbench should be able to properly compare and check for valid and invalid inputs.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciÔ¨Åes 3 potential states not speciÔ¨Åed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
