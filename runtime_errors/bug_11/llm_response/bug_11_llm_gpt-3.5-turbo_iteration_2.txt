The bug in the code is due to the way the `valid` signal is being handled in the design. In the sequential logic of the FSM, when the input number is not in the range '0' to '9', the `valid` signal is being set to 1. However, the expected behavior is that `valid` should be 0 for any input number outside the valid range.

This bug is occurring because the state is directly assigned to `num_in`, which could potentially hold values outside the range '0' to '9'. When an invalid number is given as input, it is not properly detected and the `valid` signal incorrectly indicates that the input is valid.

To fix this bug, you need to add logic that explicitly checks whether the input number is within the valid range before setting the `valid` signal. This check should be done in the FSM logic to ensure that only valid inputs result in setting `valid` to 1, while invalid inputs keep `valid` at 0.
