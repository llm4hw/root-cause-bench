The bug in the code arises from the handling of invalid input values in the FSM design. Specifically, the issue relates to how the FSM manages input values that aren't valid states (anything outside the range of 0 to 9 in your case).

### Root Cause

1. **State Assignment Directly from Input**:
   - In the code, `state <= num_in;` directly assigns the input `num_in` to the state. This means any input value provided, regardless of its validity, directly sets the state. The FSM should only process valid states when `num_in` values are between 0 and 9.

2. **Validation Signals**:
   - The `valid` signal is always set to 1, indicating the input is valid, even when `num_in` has values beyond 9. This is because there was no conditional checking in place to determine if the `num_in` is valid before setting it.

### Fix

To resolve these issues, implement conditional logic to ensure valid state transitions and properly set the valid signal:

1. **Update Sequential Logic**:
   - Before setting the state, check if `num_in` is within the valid range (0 to 9). If it is not, do not change the state or set the valid signal.

Here is how you can update the FSM sequential logic:

```verilog
// FSM sequential logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= S0; // Default state on reset
        output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
        valid <= 0; // Default invalid
    end else begin
        // Check if input is a valid state
        if (num_in <= 4'd9) begin
            state <= num_in;
            valid <= 1; // Indicate valid input
        end else begin
            valid <= 0; // Indicate invalid input
            output_data <= 8'd0; // Output default 0 for invalid input
        end
    end
end
```

This change ensures that the `state` is only updated, and the `valid` signal is set to 1 when the `num_in` is within the valid range. For any invalid input, `valid` is set to 0, and `output_data` is defaulted to 0, effectively handling inputs like 10 or 15 correctly as per your test bench expectations.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
