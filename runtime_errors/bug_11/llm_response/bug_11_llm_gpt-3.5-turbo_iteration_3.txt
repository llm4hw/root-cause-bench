The bug in this code is due to the way the `valid` signal is being handled in the FSM module `fsm_mealy_0_to_9`. In the sequential logic block, `valid` is only set to 1 when `num_in` is sampled, which implies that any input value within the range of 0 to 9 will be considered valid. However, it does not handle cases where the input value is outside this range, such as when `num_in` is greater than 9. 

In the testbench, when `num_in` is set to 4'd10 or 4'd15, the `valid` signal is still set to 1 since the logic in the FSM module only checks for the validity within the range of 0 to 9. This results in the error message "ERROR: Invalid input should not be valid." 

To fix this bug, you should update the FSM logic to also check if `num_in` is greater than 9 and set `valid` to 0 in such cases. This way, the `valid` signal will only be set to 1 when the input `num_in` is within the range of 0 to 9. Once this modification is made, the testbench will not report the error for inputs like 4'd10 or 4'd15.
