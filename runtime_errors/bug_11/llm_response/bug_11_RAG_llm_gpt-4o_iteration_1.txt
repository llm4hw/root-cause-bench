The bug in the code is related to how the `valid` signal is being set in the FSM implementation. The `valid` signal is always set to `1` in the `always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)` block unless a reset occurs. This means that any input to `num_in` will cause `valid` to be set to `1`, even when `num_in` is an invalid state, such as `4'd10` or `4'd15`.

The root cause of the issue is that the FSM currently does not explicitly handle invalid input values and treat them appropriately to set the `valid` signal to `0`. Instead, every change in `num_in` is treated as a valid state assignment due to the line `state <= num_in;` and `valid <= 1;`.

To fix this, the FSM should implement logic to check if `num_in` is a valid state (between 0 and 9) and set `valid` accordingly. Here’s how you can modify the code to fix the issue:

```verilog
    // FSM sequential logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            state <= S0; // Default state on reset
            output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
            valid <= 0; // Default invalid
        end else begin
            if (num_in <= S9) begin
                state <= num_in;
                valid <= 1;
            end else begin
                valid <= 0;
            end
        end
    end
```

In this fix, we check if `num_in` is less than or equal to `S9` (the last valid state, which corresponds to 9). If it is, we assign `num_in` to `state` and set `valid` to `1`. Otherwise, we simply set `valid` to `0` to indicate an invalid input. This ensures that inputs beyond the defined state range properly result in a `valid` signal of `0`, thereby addressing the error observed in the test bench.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
