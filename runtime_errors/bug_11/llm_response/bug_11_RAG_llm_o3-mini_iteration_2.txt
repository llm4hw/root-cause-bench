The problem is not with the testbench but with the FSM logic. In the sequential always block you always set

  valid <= 1;

regardless of whether num_in is within the valid range. Therefore, when num_in is 10 or 15, valid is still 1, causing the testbench to print the error "ERROR: Invalid input should not be valid."

Root Cause:
• The FSM does not check if num_in is in the valid range (i.e. from 0 to 9).
• The signal valid is hard‐coded to 1 for every non‐reset clock cycle.

How to Fix:
Modify the sequential always block to include a check on num_in. For example, you could rewrite the always block so that if num_in is between 0 and 9, valid is 1 and state is set to num_in. If num_in is out of range (≥10), then valid is set to 0 and you may want to reset state/output_data appropriately. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= S0;         // Default state on reset
        output_data <= 8'd0;  // Default output
        valid <= 0;          // Default invalid
    end else begin
        if(num_in <= 4'd9) begin
            state <= num_in;
            valid <= 1;
        end else begin
            state <= S0;     // Or some error state if desired
            valid <= 0;
        end
    end
end
---------------------------------------------------------------

This change checks if the input num_in is in the valid range and sets the valid flag accordingly. With this fix, when num_in is 10 or 15 the FSM will correctly indicate an invalid input, and the testbench error will no longer occur.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
