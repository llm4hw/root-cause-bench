The error you're experiencing is due to how the FSM handles invalid inputs (numbers outside the range '0' to '9'), specifically in the portion of the code responsible for setting the `valid` signal and `output_data`.

### Root Cause:
The issue lies in the FSM sequential logic section of your `always` block, where `state <= num_in;` unconditionally assigns whatever `num_in` is to the `state` without checking if `num_in` is within the valid range (0-9). Additionally, `valid <= 1;` is set regardless of whether the input is valid or not.

### Why It Is Occurring:
As coded, if `num_in` is any value, the state is set to that value, even if it is beyond '9' (such as '10' or '15'). Since there is no logic to handle invalid states, they are all treated as valid, triggering the error checks in your testbench.

### How to Fix It:
You need to modify the FSM logic to include a check for valid numbers. Only set the `state` and `valid` when `num_in` is within the valid range. Set `valid` to 0 and `output_data` to a designated invalid indicator when the input is invalid. Here's one way to implement this:

```verilog
// Modify the FSM sequential logic
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= S0; // Default state on reset
        output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
        valid <= 0; // Default invalid
    end else begin
        if (num_in <= 9) begin
            state <= num_in;
            valid <= 1;
        end else begin
            state <= 4'd0;   // or some default state
            output_data <= 8'd0; // Indicate invalid by setting output_data to zero
            valid <= 0;
        end
    end
end
```

### Explanation:
- **Validity Check**: By checking if `num_in <= 9`, the logic restricts the valid states to the defined range. Only then is the state and validity set accordingly.
- **Invalid Handling**: If outside the valid range, the `state` and `valid` are managed so that `output_data` is set to zero and `valid` is set to zero, reflecting the invalid nature of the input, which will satisfy your testbench checks.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
