The problem is that the state machine (FSM) never checks that the input number is actually within 0–9. In the sequential logic block, regardless of what num_in is, the state is simply set to num_in and the valid flag is always set to 1. This means that even when num_in is 10 or 15 (which are outside the desired range), the FSM still marks the output as valid. The testbench expects valid to be 0 for invalid inputs and output_data to be 0—so it finds an error because the logic doesn’t reject out‐of-range inputs.

In other words, the bug occurs because there is no validation of num_in to determine if it is within the allowed range. The logic needs to include a condition to check if the input is less than 10. Without this check, the FSM always treats any 4-bit number as valid, leading to an error during simulation when the testbench detects that an “invalid” input (like 10 or 15) is marked as valid.

The fix would involve adding a condition to the design that explicitly sets valid to 0 and output_data to 0 when num_in represents a number outside the 0–9 range.
