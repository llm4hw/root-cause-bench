The issue stems from the way the FSM (Finite State Machine) is designed, especially the part where the `state` and `valid` signals are assigned in the FSM sequential logic. The FSM currently assigns a state directly based on the input `num_in` without any checks to see if `num_in` is indeed within the specified valid range of states ('0' to '9').

Here’s a breakdown of the issue:

1. **State Assignment**: The FSM assigns `state` to `num_in` directly without validation. That means if `num_in` is out of the range of '0' to '9', such as '10' or '15', the state is still set to these values.
   
2. **Valid Signal**: The `valid` signal is always set to `1`, regardless of the value of `num_in`. It doesn't get flagged as invalid if the input is outside the desired range.

To solve the problem, you need to add validation to ensure that the `state` and `valid` signals are properly assigned only when `num_in` is within the valid range. Here's how you can fix it:

**Updated Sequential Logic with Validation**:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        state <= S0; // Default state on reset
        output_data <= 8'd0; // Default output
        valid <= 0; // Default invalid
    end else begin
        if (num_in <= 9) begin  // Ensure num_in is within valid range
            state <= num_in;
            valid <= 1;
        end else begin
            state <= S0; // Set to default state
            valid <= 0; // Mark as invalid input
        end
    end
end
```

**Explanation**:
- Before assigning the state, check if `num_in` is within the range of 0 to 9 (`if (num_in <= 9)`).
- If it is valid, proceed to assign `state` and set `valid` to `1`.
- If it is invalid, revert the `state` to a default valid state (e.g., `S0`) and set `valid` to `0`.

By adding this validation, the FSM will correctly handle inputs outside the valid range, and the test bench should pass without errors for invalid inputs.

Alternatively, the output assignment for Status can be combined into the always@( * ) block that
chooses what the next state should be (see Program 21). It is seperated here for clarity.

As 3 bits can specify a total of 8 states (0-7), our encoding speciﬁes 3 potential states not speciﬁed
as being actual states. There are several ways of dealing with this problem:
1. Ignore it, and always press Reset as a way of initializing the FSM.
2. Specify these states, and make non-conditional transitions from them to the STATE_Initial....
