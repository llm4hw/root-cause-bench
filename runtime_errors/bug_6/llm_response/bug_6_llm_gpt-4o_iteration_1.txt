The error occurs in the sixth test case of your testbench, which expects the `outResult` to be greater than `3'b110` (i.e., greater than binary 110), when `longTimeHold` is set during the Pedestrian (Ped) state. Let's break down why this is happening:

1. **Module Analysis**: When the system is in the `Ped` state, the lower block of combinational logic within the module checks the `longTimeHold` signal. If `longTimeHold` is true, the current design sets `outResult` to `3'b101`. If `longTimeHold` is false, `outResult` is set to `3'b110`. Thus, when `longTimeHold` is high, `outResult` becomes `3'b101`, which is less than `3'b110`.

2. **Testbench Analysis**: The testbench expects `outResult` to be greater than `3'b110` when `Ped` state is active, and `longTimeHold` is set. This implies it expects the `outResult` to be a value like `3'b111` or higher in numerical value, during this condition.

3. **Cause of the Bug**: The conditional logic in the state machine is not assigning a correct value greater than `3'b110` when transitioning out of the `Ped` state with `longTimeHold`. The current implementation assigns `outResult` as `3'b101`, which is less than what's expected for this test case.

4. **Explanation of Error Messages**: Specifically, the message `ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = 101 (Expected > 110)` indicates that with `longTimeHold` set, the `outResult` is `3'b101`, whereas the testbench expects a binary value larger than `3'b110`. The logic determining `outResult` doesn't match the expectations of the testbench under these conditions. 

The root of the problem lies in the mismatch between what the testbench expects and how the RTL logic assigns values to `outResult`. An examination and alignment of expectations and assignments will be necessary to reconcile the test case with the functional objectives of the module.
