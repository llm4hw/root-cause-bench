The problem is not with the test bench but with the logic in the Ped state. In your module’s always block that computes outResult, you have written for the Ped state:

  Ped: if (longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
    else outResult = 3'b110;

This means that if pedControl is active and longTimeHold is asserted, outResult becomes 3'b101 (which is 5 in decimal). However, Test Case 6 expects that when the pedestrian control is active with longTimeHold asserted, the output should be a value greater than 3'b110 (i.e. greater than 6), for example, 3'b111 (7 in decimal).

To fix the bug, swap the assignment values in the Ped state so that when longTimeHold is true the output is greater than 3'b110. For example, you can change the code to:

  Ped: if (longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b111;
    else outResult = 3'b110;

This change ensures that when the pedestrian signal is triggered with longTimeHold, outResult becomes 3'b111 (7), which is greater than 3'b110 (6), thereby satisfying the test bench’s check for Test Case 6.
