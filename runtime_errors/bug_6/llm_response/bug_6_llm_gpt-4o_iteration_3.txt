The error message from the test bench indicates that Test Case 6 failed because the output `outResult` was expected to be greater than `110` but was instead `101`. Let's analyze the code to identify the issue.

In the `top_module`, the output `outResult` is controlled by an `always` block that depends on the current `state` and the `longTimeHold` signal. The `state` is changed according to the traffic light sequence, controlled by the `state` register and the `next` state logic. 

For Test Case 6, we have the following conditions:
- The test bench expects that when `longTimeHold` is set, the output `outResult` should be greater than `110`. 
- However, when the pedestrian signal `pedControl` is triggered with `longTimeHold = 1`, according to the `always` block for `outResult`, the module assigns `3'b101` to `outResult` in the `Ped` state.

This is contrary to the expectation set by the test bench which expects an output greater than `110` possibly implying a value of at least `3'b111`. 

The core issue here is a mismatch between the test bench's expectation (`outResult` should be greater than `110`) and the logic in the Verilog code (`outResult` is set to `101` when in `Ped` state with `longTimeHold`). This indicates that the logic inside the `Ped` state when `longTimeHold` is high needs to be re-evaluated based on design requirements, not that there's an error in state transition or clock setting.

This issue can typically be resolved by re-evaluating the requirements or specifications for this signal when the `longTimeHold` is active in pedestrian control, and deciding on the correct expected value for `outResult` according to the test bench's intention or correcting the specification that test bench is validating against. You might need to change the assigned value in the conditional statement within the `Ped` state to ensure it matches what is expected in the testbench.
