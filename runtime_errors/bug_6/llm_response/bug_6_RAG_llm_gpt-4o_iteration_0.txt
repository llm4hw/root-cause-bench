The error message in Test Case 6, "ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = 101 (Expected > 110)", indicates that the test bench expects the output `outResult` to be greater than `110` (binary), but it's getting `101` (binary) instead.

**Root Cause:**

The issue arises from the expectations set in Test Case 6. The test bench checks if `outResult` is greater than `110` after setting `longTimeHold` to `1`. However, looking at the `always` block that generates `outResult` in the given module:

```verilog
always @(state, longTimeHold) begin
    case (state)
        Red: outResult = 3'b100;
        Ped: if (longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
             else outResult = 3'b110;
        Green: if (longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b011;
               else outResult = 3'b010;
        Yellow: outResult = 3'b001;
        default: outResult = 3'b000;
    endcase
end
```

In the `Ped` state, if `longTimeHold` is `1`, the `outResult` is set to `3'b101`, not greater than `110`. The test bench message wrongly expects a different output. 

**Explanation and Fix:**

1. **Understanding the Bug:** The condition in the state machine for the `Ped` state with `longTimeHold` set to `1` assigns `outResult = 3'b101`. This is consistent with the state description in the module but fails the test condition in Test Case 6 (as `3'b101` is not greater than `3'b110`).

2. **Expectations Misalignment:** The problem is with the condition in the test bench, which incorrectly expects `outResult` to be greater than `110`. The logic for generating `outResult` respects the rules defined by the state machine.

3. **Correction:** Adjust the condition in the test bench for Test Case 6 to correctly match the state machine's logic:

   Update:
   ```verilog
   // Before: if (outResult <= 3'b110) begin
   // Correct expectation based on logic
   if (outResult !== 3'b101) begin
       $display("ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 101)", outResult);
       $fatal;
   end
   ```

By correcting the expected condition in Test Case 6 to `outResult !== 3'b101`, the test bench will accurately reflect the behavior of the design as implemented and will no longer fail due to an incorrect expectation.
