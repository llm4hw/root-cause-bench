Based on the provided code and error message, the bug occurs in **Test Case 6** of the testbench. Here's a breakdown:

### Root Cause:
1. **State Transition Timing**:  
   - The testbench sets `longTimeHold = 1` and waits `#10` (simulation time units) before checking `outResult`.  
   - During this `#10` delay, a clock edge occurs at `#5` (since the clock period is `#10` with `always #5 clk = ~clk`), triggering a state transition from `Red` to `Ped`.  
   - In the `Ped` state, the design outputs:  
     - `3'b101` if `longTimeHold == 1`  
     - `3'b110` if `longTimeHold == 0`  
   Since `longTimeHold` is set to `1`, `outResult` becomes `3'b101` (decimal 5).

2. **Incorrect Test Condition**:  
   The testbench expects `outResult > 3'b110` (decimal 6):  
   ```verilog
   if (outResult <= 3'b110) // Fails when outResult=101 (5 <= 6)
   ```
   - `3'b101` (5) is **less than** `3'b110` (6), causing the failure.  
   - The design can **never output a value > 6** (`3'b110`), making this expectation invalid.

---

### Fix:
Modify **Test Case 6** in the testbench to check for the correct value (`3'b101`):  
```verilog
// Test Case 6: Pedestrian signal triggered with longTimeHold
longTimeHold = 1;
#10;
if (outResult !== 3'b101) begin // Check for 101 instead of >110
    $display("ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 101)", outResult);
    $fatal;
end
```

### Why This Fix Works:
- The design correctly outputs `3'b101` in the `Ped` state when `longTimeHold=1`.  
- The updated condition validates the actual expected value (`101`) instead of an impossible value (`>110`).

---

### Additional Note:
**Test Case 2** also has a misleading error message (says `Expected: 101` but checks for `110`). Fix it to avoid future confusion:  
```verilog
// Test Case 2 (Correction)
if (outResult !== 3'b110) begin
    $display("ERROR: Test Case 2 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 110)", outResult); // Fix message
    $fatal;
end
``` 

### Summary:
- **Bug**: Testbench error due to incorrect value check in Test Case 6.  
- **Fix**: Update the test condition to expect `3'b101` instead of `> 3'b110`.  
- **Design Validity**: The design (`top_module`) operates correctly; the issue is solely in the testbench.
