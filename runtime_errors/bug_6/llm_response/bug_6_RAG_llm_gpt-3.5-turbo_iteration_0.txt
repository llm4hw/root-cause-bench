One bug in the provided code is in Test Case 6. The condition `if (outResult <= 3'b110)` is incorrect for comparing a 3-bit value. Comparing if `outResult` is less than or equal to 3'b110 does not match the desired behavior mentioned in the error message. The error message states that the expected result should be greater than `110`, implying that the correct comparison should be checking for values greater than that.

To fix this issue, you should update the comparison condition in Test Case 6 from `if (outResult <= 3'b110)` to `if (outResult > 3'b110)`. This change will ensure that the test checks for results greater than `110` as expected. 

Making this adjustment will align the comparison with the expected result and resolve the error message indicating Test Case 6 failing due to the condition mismatch.
