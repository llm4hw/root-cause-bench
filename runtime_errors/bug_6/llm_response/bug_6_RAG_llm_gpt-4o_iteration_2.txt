The error in Test Case 6 occurs because the condition in the test bench expects `outResult` to be greater than `110` (or `6` in decimal), but during the simulation, it is resulting in `101` (or `5` in decimal).

Let’s analyze the Verilog code and test bench related to the pedestrian signal and `longTimeHold` conditions:

### Root Cause:
1. **Module Code**: 
    - In your `top_module`, within the `always` block for setting `outResult`, when the state is `Ped`, it checks:
      ```verilog
      Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
      else outResult = 3'b110;
      ```
    - This means when `longTimeHold` is asserted (i.e., is `1`), the `outResult` is set to `101`.

2. **Test Bench**: 
    - In the test bench, for Test Case 6, you have:
      ```verilog
      if (outResult <= 3'b110) begin
          $display("ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = %b (Expected > 110)", outResult);
          $fatal;
      end
      ```
    - This condition checks if `outResult` is less than or equal to `110`, which means that it expects a result greater than `110`.

### Why the Error Occurs:
- Your expectations in the test bench's Test Case 6 do not align with the behavior defined in the `top_module`. When `longTimeHold` is asserted, `outResult` is designed to be `101`, which is exactly opposite to your test bench expectation that `outResult` should be greater than `110`.

### How to Fix it:
1. **Align Expectations:**
    - If the expected behavior of your module when `longTimeHold` is asserted is indeed meant to produce `101`, then the test bench should be corrected to match this expectation:
      ```verilog
      if (outResult !== 3'b101) begin
          $display("ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 101)", outResult);
          $fatal;
      end
      ```

2. **Module Update (Optional):**
    - If the test bench’s condition of `outResult > 110` is indeed what is correct according to the functional requirement, then the logic in your `top_module` defining what `outResult` should be when `longTimeHold` is asserted needs to be adjusted.

Given the structure and logic provided in the `top_module`, it is more plausible that the expectation should be `101` (since the module's logic set during `longTimeHold` is directly responsible for that), so aligning the test bench's expectation is likely the correct fix.
