The bug in the provided code and test bench is in the comparison statement of Test Case 6. The comparison condition is set to "outResult <= 3'b110" when it should actually be "outResult >= 3'b110" based on the error message "outResult = 101 (Expected > 110)". 

To fix this bug, the comparison in Test Case 6 should be updated to check if "outResult" is greater than or equal to 3'b110 rather than just less than or equal to. 
So, the line in Test Case 6 should be modified from:
``` if (outResult <= 3'b110) ```
to:
``` if (outResult >= 3'b110) ```

This will ensure that Test Case 6 passes when the "outResult" value is greater than or equal to 3'b110. After making this change, the simulation should be run again to verify that all test cases pass.
