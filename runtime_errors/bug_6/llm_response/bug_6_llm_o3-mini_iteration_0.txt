The error arises because the output value for the Ped state when the long hold signal is active does not match what the test bench expects. In the Pedestrian state, the module’s combinational logic sets the output to one binary constant when longTimeHold is high and a different constant when it is low—but the constant chosen for the longTimeHold = 1 case is lower (3'b101) than the alternative (3'b110). According to the test bench, when longTimeHold is active, the output should be a value that is greater than 3'b110 (i.e. a higher numerical value in binary), not 3'b101. 

The bug occurs because the values used for the Ped state outputs are essentially swapped (or chosen inconsistently) relative to the expected ordering of their binary magnitudes. This mismatch causes the simulation for test case 6 to fail: when longTimeHold is true, the module produces 101 (which is less than 110) but the test bench explicitly checks that the value should be greater than 110.

To fix the issue, one must reexamine the intended design and adjust the constant values (or the conditions leading to them) so that the assigned output in the Ped state when longTimeHold is active is indeed a binary number greater than 3'b110.
