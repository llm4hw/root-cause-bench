The bug in the test case 6 check is likely due to the comparison operator being incorrect. The comparison `outResult <= 3'b110` checks if `outResult` is less than or equal to `3'b110`, which is binary 110 (6 in decimal). 

To fix this issue, the comparison should be corrected to check if `outResult` is greater than `3'b110`. The comparison should be updated to `outResult > 3'b110` to accurately verify if `outResult` is greater than binary 110 (6 in decimal).

Update the comparison line in test case 6 from:
```if (outResult <= 3'b110)```
to:
```if (outResult > 3'b110)```

By making this change, the comparison will correctly check if `outResult` is greater than binary 110 and the test case 6 should pass as expected.
