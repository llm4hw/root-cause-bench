The bug in the code is due to the comparison condition used in Test Case 6 of the testbench. The condition `if (outResult <= 3'b110)` is incorrect because it is checking if `outResult` is less than or equal to `3'b110`, which is not the expected behavior according to the error message. The error message states that the expected value for Test Case 6 should be greater than `3'b110`, but the current condition does not properly reflect this.

To fix this bug, the comparison condition in Test Case 6 should be changed to check if `outResult` is greater than `3'b110` instead. Modifying the condition to `if (outResult > 3'b110)` will ensure that the code checks that `outResult` is indeed greater than the expected value, addressing the bug and aligning with the error message's expectation.
