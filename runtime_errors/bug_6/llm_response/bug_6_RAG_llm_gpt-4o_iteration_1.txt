The issue arises during Test Case 6, which is verifying the output when the pedestrian signal is triggered with `longTimeHold` set to 1.

Let's break down what's happening:

1. **Initial State**: The system starts in the `Red` state after reset because of the code:
   ```verilog
   if (~resetn) state <= Red;
   ```

2. **State Transition**: With `pedControl = 1`, the state transitions to `Ped` based on this block of code:
   ```verilog
   Red: if (pedControl) next = Ped;
   ```
   The expected output for the `Ped` state is:
   ```verilog
   Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
   else outResult = 3'b110;
   ```

3. **Test Case 6**: Here, `pedControl` is kept high, and `longTimeHold` is set to 1, expecting the output to be greater than `110` (i.e., greater than `3'b110`). However, this doesn't align with the logic provided:
   - The code sets `outResult` to `3'b101` when `longTimeHold = 1`, which is not greater than `3'b110`, thereby causing a test failure:
     ```verilog
     Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
     ```

**The Bug**: The inequality in the test case logic (`if (outResult <= 3'b110)`) does not match the behavior of the design because `3'b101` is indeed less than `3'b110`, while the message expects greater than `110`.

**The Fix**:
- **Fix the test logic** or **reconsider expected outcomes** for when `longTimeHold` is 1. If the expected value is indeed supposed to be greater than `110`, update the design logic for the `Ped` state:
  
  Update the design to set a higher value in the `Ped` state with `longTimeHold` set:

  ```verilog
  Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b111; // Change to a value greater than 110
  ```

- **Alternatively**, if the expected result of `3'b101` is correct, the issue lies within the test bench check. Modify the test expectation to be `3'b101`:

  ```verilog
  if (outResult !== 3'b101) begin // Correct the expected output
  ```

Choose the option that is consistent with your intended operation for your system design.
