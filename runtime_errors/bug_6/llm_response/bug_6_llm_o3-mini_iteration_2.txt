The problem occurs in the combinational block that drives the output for the Ped state. In that block, when the state is Ped, the output is controlled by an if‐statement checking longTimeHold. When longTimeHold is active (true), the design assigns an output value that is lower (binary 101) than when longTimeHold is false (binary 110). However, the test bench expects that when longTimeHold is asserted in the Ped state, the output will be “greater than” 110 (for example, something like 111). This mismatch in the constants used for the two conditions in the Ped state is the root of the bug.

In other words, the design’s output for the Ped state is reversed relative to the intended or expected behavior. When longTimeHold is high the expected output should be a higher binary value, yet the code assigns the lower one and vice versa. Because the test bench is explicitly checking that the output is greater than 110 in test case 6, the simulation fails.

By reexamining the intended behavior and comparing it with the assigned binary numbers in the Ped state of the output logic, one can see that the constant values in the “if/else” block for Ped are mismatched with what the test bench expects.
