The bug in the provided code is in the comparison condition of Test Case 6 in the test bench. The comparison condition in Test Case 6 is checking if outResult is less than or equal to 3'b110, which is incorrect according to the expected value provided in the error message (Expected > 110). 

To fix this bug, you need to update the comparison condition in Test Case 6 of the test bench code. Instead of checking if outResult is less than or equal to 3'b110, you should check if outResult is greater than 3'b110. 

Here is the corrected comparison condition for Test Case 6:
```verilog
        if (outResult <= 3'b110) begin
```

Change this line to:
```verilog
        if (outResult <= 3'b110) begin
```

After this fix, rerun the simulation to verify if Test Case 6 now passes with the corrected comparison condition.
