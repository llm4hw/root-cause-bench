The bug in the code occurs in Test Case 6 of the test bench. The error message indicates that when the pedestrian signal is triggered with `longTimeHold` set to 1, the `outResult` is expected to be greater than `110` (in binary), but the code does not produce this expected result.

**Root Cause:**

In the always block handling `state` and `longTimeHold`, the value of `outResult` for the `Ped` state with `longTimeHold` set to 1 is incorrectly set:

```verilog
Ped: if (longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
else outResult = 3'b110;
```

According to the test bench, when `longTimeHold` is asserted, the `outResult` should be greater than `110`. However, in the code, the value is set to `3'b101` (which is `5` in decimal). The test bench expects a value greater than `3'b110` (which is `6` in decimal), which implies the `outResult` should be at least `3'b111` (which is `7` in decimal) or higher.

**Fix:**

To fix this issue, modify the block under the `Ped` state to assign a value greater than `3'b110` when `longTimeHold` is 1:

```verilog
Ped: if (longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b111;
else outResult = 3'b110;
```

This change ensures that when in the `Ped` state and `longTimeHold` is active, the `outResult` will be `3'b111`, which satisfies the condition of being greater than `3'b110`. With this modification, the test bench should pass all test cases.
