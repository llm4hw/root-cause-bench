The error is caused by an incorrect assignment in the block that drives the output when the state is Ped (pedestrian). In that part of the code the designer has used a conditional that assigns one binary value when the longHold signal is asserted and a different binary value when it is not. However, the values are “flipped” relative to what the test bench expects.

Specifically, when longTimeHold is true, the code assigns a lower numerical value (binary 101) in the Ped state, but the test bench is set up so that the resulting outResult should compare as greater than binary 110. In other words, the expected behavior is that longTimeHold being high should produce a hexadecimal or binary value that is numerically higher than 110 (for example, 111) rather than the lower value (101) produced by the present assignment. Because of this discrepancy the simulation shows outResult = 101 when longTimeHold is asserted during the Ped state, triggering the test case failure.

The bug is occurring because the designer has inadvertently swapped the intended output values under the two conditions for the Ped state. In the context of the test bench the “if(longTimeHold)” branch should yield a higher value than the “else” branch, but the code assigns the lower value (101) when longTimeHold is true.

To fix this issue, one would need to reassign the output value in the Ped state so that when longTimeHold is asserted the output is given a binary value that is numerically greater than 110 (for example, 111 rather than 101), and when longTimeHold is low a lower value is used. This would align the module’s behavior with the test bench’s expectations.
