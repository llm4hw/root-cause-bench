Based on the error message and analysis of the code, the bug is in the test bench's Test Case 6 implementation. Here's the breakdown:

**Bug Explanation:**
1. **Incorrect Condition in Test Case 6:**
   - The test bench expects `outResult > 3'b110` (binary 6) when both `pedControl` and `longTimeHold` are active
   - The design specification shows that in the Pedestrian (`Ped`) state with `longTimeHold=1`, the output should be `3'b101` (binary 5), not a value greater than 6

2. **State Transition Issue:**
   - When Test Case 6 executes, the design is in the `Red` state (from previous Test Case 5)
   - With `pedControl` still active (set in Test Case 2) and `longTimeHold` now set to 1:
     - Next state becomes `Ped` (due to pedestrian request)
     - Output becomes `3'b101` (as specified in design)
   - The test incorrectly expects a value >6 when it should expect exactly `3'b101`

**Fix:**
Modify Test Case 6 in the test bench to check for the correct output value:

```verilog
// Test Case 6: Pedestrian signal triggered with longTimeHold
longTimeHold = 1;
#10;
if (outResult !== 3'b101) begin  // Correct expected value
    $display("ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 101)", outResult);
    $fatal;
end
```

**Additional Test Bench Issues:**
1. **Test Case 2 also has incorrect expectations:**
   - Should expect `3'b110` (not `3'b101`) when in `Ped` state without `longTimeHold`
   - Current implementation has conflicting condition and error message

2. **Test Case 2 Correction Needed:**
```verilog
// Test Case 2: Pedestrian signal triggered without longTimeHold
pedControl = 1;
#10;
if (outResult !== 3'b110) begin  // Fix expected value
    $display("ERROR: Test Case 2 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 110)", outResult);
    $fatal;
end
```

**Why This Matters:**
- The design correctly implements the specification:
  ```verilog
  Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
  ```
- The test bench errors were due to:
  1. Misunderstanding the design's output encoding
  2. Using range checks (`> 110`) instead of exact value checks
  3. Inconsistent error messages (Test Case 2 mentioned `101` but checked for `110`)

After making these corrections, all test cases should pass as the design functionality matches the specified behavior for all states and input combinations.
