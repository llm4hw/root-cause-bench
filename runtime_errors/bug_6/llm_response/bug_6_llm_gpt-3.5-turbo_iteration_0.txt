The bug in the code is occurring because of a logic error in the "always" block that assigns values to the "outResult" variable in the "top_module" module. 

Specifically, in the case when the state is Ped and "longTimeHold" is true, the code assigns the value 3'b101 to "outResult" instead of 3'b110, which was expected in the test case. This is due to the incorrect assignment of values based on the conditions in the "always" block.

To fix this issue, the logic in the "always" block that assigns values to "outResult" based on the state and "longTimeHold" condition needs to be revised to ensure that the correct value (3'b110 in this case) is assigned when the state is Ped and "longTimeHold" is true.
