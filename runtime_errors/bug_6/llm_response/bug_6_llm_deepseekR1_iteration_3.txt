The error in Test Case 6 stems from three interconnected issues in the test bench and design interaction:

1. **Incorrect Test Condition Logic**:  
   The test expects `outResult > 3'b110` (decimal 6), but the design never outputs values above `3'b110`. The maximum output is `3'b110` itself (Ped state with `longTimeHold=0`). For `longTimeHold=1` in the Ped state, the design outputs `3'b101` (5), which is *less* than 6. The test's expectation of a value >6 is fundamentally flawed.

2. **State Timing Mismatch**:  
   The test bench waits `#10` (two clock edges) after setting `longTimeHold=1`, expecting to capture the Ped state output. However:
   - After the **first clock edge**, the state transitions from Red to Ped, producing `outResult=3'b101`.
   - After the **second clock edge**, the state transitions to Green, producing `3'b011` (if `longTimeHold=1`).  
   The test checks *after two edges*, missing the Ped state entirely and landing in Green where the output is `3'b011` (3)—far below the expected >6.

3. **Race Condition in Sampling**:  
   The test bench checks `outResult` at the exact simulation time of the clock edge (`#10` aligns with the second posedge). At this instant:
   - The clock edge triggers the state register update (non-blocking assignment)
   - Combinational output logic hasn't propagated the new state (Green) yet
   - The test samples the *previous* state's output (Ped: `3'b101`) due to Verilog's scheduling of non-blocking assignments.

**Secondary Test Bench Issues**:  
- **Test Case 2**: The error message incorrectly states `Expected: 101` when the design should output `110` for Ped with `longTimeHold=0`.  
- **Test Case 6 Logic**: The combination of waiting too long *and* incorrect expectation (>110) causes a false failure. The correct output to expect after one clock edge would be `3'b101`.

**Why the Design Isn't at Fault**:  
The state machine operates correctly:
- `Ped` state always transitions to `Green` on the next clock
- Outputs update combinationally based on `state` and `longTimeHold`
- No state encoding or transition errors exist in the RTL.

**Fix Direction**:  
Revise the test bench to:
1. Correct all expected values (e.g., Test Case 6 should expect `3'b101`).
2. Wait only *one clock edge* after setting `longTimeHold=1` to capture the Ped state.
3. Add a small delay (`#1`) after clock edges to avoid sampling during non-blocking assignment updates.
4. Fix inconsistent error messages (e.g., Test Case 2).

The design requires no modifications—the core issue lies in test bench timing and validation logic.
