The bug is in the output values produced in the Pedestrian (Ped) state. In your design’s output block you have:

  Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;  
    else outResult = 3'b110;

However, the test bench expects that when longTimeHold is asserted while in the Ped state (Test Case 6), the output “outResult” should have a value greater than 3'b110 (i.e. greater than binary 110, decimal 6). The value you’re currently providing (3'b101, which is binary 101 or decimal 5) does not meet that criterion; indeed, 101 in binary is less than 110.

Where the test bench for Test Case 6 does:
  if (outResult <= 3'b110) … // expecting outResult > 3'b110
the current output of 3'b101 fails the test.

To fix the bug, you need to adjust the assignment in the Ped state so that when longTimeHold is high, the output is greater than 3'b110. For example, you might change it to:

  Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b111;  
    else outResult = 3'b110;

With this change, when longTimeHold is active, outResult becomes 3'b111 (decimal 7), which is indeed greater than 3'b110 (decimal 6) and should satisfy the test bench condition.

In summary:
• Why is it occurring? Because the wrong binary value (3'b101) is assigned in the Ped state when longTimeHold is high.
• The fix is to change that assignment (for example, to 3'b111) so that the output meets the expected condition from the test bench.
