The bug in the test bench occurs in Test Case 6. The comparison `if (outResult <= 3'b110)` in Test Case 6 is incorrect; it should be `if (outResult !== 3'b110)` because the expected result is 3'b110, not less than or equal to 3'b110. 

To fix this bug, you should change the comparison in Test Case 6 from `if (outResult <= 3'b110)` to `if (outResult !== 3'b110)`. This change will ensure that the comparison checks for an exact match with the expected value 3'b110 and no longer erroneously allows results that are less than or equal to 3'b110 to pass the test case.
