The bug occurs in the test bench's Test Case 6, where the condition and expected value for the pedestrian signal with `longTimeHold` are incorrect.

### Root Cause:
1. **Incorrect Test Condition**: Test Case 6 checks if `outResult <= 3'b110` (binary 6) and expects a value *greater* than 110. However, the design specification states:
   - In `Ped` state with `longTimeHold=1`, `outResult` should be `3'b101` (binary 5).
   - The condition `outResult <= 110` evaluates to `true` for `101` (5) since 5 ≤ 6, triggering a false failure.

2. **Mismatched Expected Value**: The test expects a value >110 (e.g., 111), but the design only produces `101` or `110` in the `Ped` state.

### Fix:
Modify **Test Case 6** in the test bench to:
1. Check for the correct value `3'b101` (binary 5).
2. Update the error message to reflect the expected value.

### Fixed Test Case 6 Code:
```verilog
// Test Case 6: Pedestrian signal triggered with longTimeHold
longTimeHold = 1;
#10;
if (outResult !== 3'b101) begin
    $display("ERROR: Test Case 6 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 101)", outResult);
    $fatal;
end
```

### Additional Issue (Test Case 2):
The test bench has a **secondary bug** in Test Case 2:
- **Problem**: The error message expects `101`, but the correct value for `Ped` state with `longTimeHold=0` is `110`.
- **Fix** (recommended for full correctness):
  ```verilog
  // Test Case 2: Pedestrian signal triggered without longTimeHold
  pedControl = 1;
  #10;
  if (outResult !== 3'b110) begin
      $display("ERROR: Test Case 2 failed. outResult = %b (Expected: 110)", outResult); // Fix message
      $fatal;
  end
  ```

### Why This Fix Works:
- The design correctly outputs `101` in `Ped` state when `longTimeHold=1` (verified in the state machine's output logic).
- The updated test condition now matches the design specification, allowing Test Case 6 to pass when the correct value (`101`) is observed.

### Design Verification:
The state machine operates as intended:
- `Ped` state output: 
  - `longTimeHold=1` → `101`
  - `longTimeHold=0` → `110`  
No changes to the design (`top_module`) are needed. The bug is purely in the test bench's verification logic.
