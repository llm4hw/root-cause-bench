The error message for Test Case 6 indicates that `outResult` is not meeting the expected condition during testing when Pedestrian signal is triggered with `longTimeHold`. The expected condition is that the `outResult` should be greater than 110 in binary, which is 6 in decimal (i.e., `outResult` > 110).

Examining the code for the `top_module`, specifically the final `always` block that determines `outResult`, we see:

```verilog
always@(state, longTimeHold) begin
    case (state)
        ...
        Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b101;
        else outResult = 3'b110;
        ...
endcase
```

1. **Bug Identification:**
   - When the state is `Ped`, and `longTimeHold` is asserted (i.e., `longTimeHold = 1`), the output `outResult` is set to `3'b101` which is 5 in decimal, not greater than 110 in binary.

2. **Reason why it's failing:**
   - The test bench for Test Case 6 is expecting `outResult` to be greater than `3'b110` (which is 6 in decimal) when the pedestrian signal is triggered with `longTimeHold` being high.
   - The assignment `outResult = 3'b101` when `longTimeHold` is high inside the Pedestrian state does not satisfy this condition.

3. **How to fix it:**
   - Ensure the `outResult` is set to a value greater than `3'b110` (6 in decimal) when in the `Ped` state with `longTimeHold` asserted. This means changing the condition to set `outResult` to, for instance, `3'b111` (7 in decimal) or any value satisfying `> 6`.

Here's a potential fix for the logic block:

```verilog
always@(state, longTimeHold) begin
    case (state)
        ...
        Ped: if(longTimeHold) outResult = 3'b111; // Changed to satisfy the condition of Test Case 6
        else outResult = 3'b110;
        ...
endcase
```

This modification will ensure that the condition `outResult > 3'b110` is met when Test Case 6 is executed, and should resolve the error.
