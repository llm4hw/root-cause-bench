The bug is in the feedback connection of the ring oscillator's inverters. The incorrect assignment causes each inverter's input to be connected to its own output instead of forming a closed loop through all inverters. This prevents oscillation, leading to the error.

**Why it occurs:**
The line `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};` incorrectly connects `lut_ins[i]` to `lut_outs[i]` for all `i`. This creates 11 individual feedback loops (each inverter's output feeds its own input), which cannot oscillate. A proper ring oscillator requires each inverter's input to connect to the **previous** inverter's output, with the last inverter feeding back to the first.

**Fix:**
Replace the faulty `assign` statement with a generate loop that correctly wires the inverters in a chain:

```verilog
// Replace: assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};

genvar i;
generate
    for (i = 0; i < 11; i = i + 1) begin : feedback
        if (i == 0) begin
            assign lut_ins[i] = lut_outs[10]; // Close the loop: last inverter ‚Üí first
        end else begin
            assign lut_ins[i] = lut_outs[i-1]; // Connect to previous inverter
        end
    end
endgenerate
```

**Explanation:**
- For inverter `i=0`, the input comes from the last inverter (`lut_outs[10]`).
- For `i>0`, the input comes from the previous inverter (`lut_outs[i-1]`).
- This forms a proper ring structure, enabling oscillation. The testbench will now detect toggling as the ring oscillator functions correctly.
