The bug is in the feedback wiring of the ring oscillator's inverters. The `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};` line incorrectly connects the inverters, creating multiple small loops (pairs of inverters and a self-loop) instead of a single chain. Each inverter's input is wired to the output of a different inverter in reverse order (e.g., inverter 1's input is inverter 9's output), forming non-oscillating even-stage loops. The self-loop (inverter 5) also cannot sustain oscillation. To fix this, the feedback must connect each inverter's input to the output of the previous inverter in sequence, forming a single ring of 11 inverters.
