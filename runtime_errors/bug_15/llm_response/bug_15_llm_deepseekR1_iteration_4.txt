The root cause of the error is an incorrect feedback path configuration in the ring oscillator's inverter chain. The assignment `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]}` creates independent self-loops for each inverter instead of a daisy-chained ring structure. This occurs because each inverter's input is directly wired to its own output, preventing oscillation. To fix this, the feedback must chain inverter outputs to subsequent inputs (e.g., inverter 0's input should connect to inverter 10's output, inverter 1's input to inverter 0's output, etc.). The correct wiring requires shifting the `lut_outs` array to form a proper closed loop.
