The error message "ERROR: Ring oscillator output (OUT) never toggled. Likely feedback wiring issue." indicates that the output signal "OUT" of the ring oscillator module is not toggling as expected during the simulation. This could be due to the way the feedback loop is configured in the design.

In the provided code, the issue seems to be with the way the `last_out` variable is being used to check for toggling of the `OUT` signal. The `last_out` is initialized before the initial part of the simulation loop, and then the comparison is made with the current value of `OUT`. However, the `last_out` variable is never updated within the loop. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and ultimately trigger the error message.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `last_out` variable within the repeat loop so that it correctly tracks the previous value of `OUT`. Add the line `last_out = OUT;` inside the repeat loop after the if-else block. This will ensure that the `last_out` is always up to date and the toggling check is accurate.

Here's the updated section of the initial block within the testbench code:
```verilog
        repeat (1000) begin
            #10;
            if (OUT === last_out)
                stable_cycles = stable_cycles + 1;
            else begin
                $display("Ring oscillator is toggling. OUT changed at time %0t ns", $time);
                $finish;
            end
            last_out = OUT; // Update last_out here
        end
```

By making this change, the testbench should now accurately track the toggling behavior of the `OUT` signal and should not trigger the error message anymore.
