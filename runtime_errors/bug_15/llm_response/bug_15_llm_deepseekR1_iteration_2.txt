The bug is due to incorrect feedback connections between the inverters in the ring oscillator. The `lut_ins` assignment creates a broken chain by connecting each inverter's input to the wrong previous inverter's output. 

**Why it's occurring:**  
The `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};` statement incorrectly wires the inverters. For a functional ring oscillator, each inverter's input must connect to the output of the **previous inverter** in the chain (with the first input connected to the last inverter's output). However, the current code connects `lut_ins[1]` to `lut_outs[9]` (inverter 9's output), `lut_ins[2]` to `lut_outs[8]`, etc., breaking the sequential chain. This miswiring prevents oscillation because the feedback loop is not closed properly.

**Fix direction:**  
Adjust the `lut_ins` assignment to ensure each inverter's input is driven by the **correct preceding inverter's output** (e.g., inverter 1's input connects to inverter 0's output, not inverter 9's). The concatenation order must reflect a proper daisy-chain of inverters, not reversed or disjointed connections.
