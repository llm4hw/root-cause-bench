The problem is that the intended feedback loop isn’t wired correctly. The designer meant for the outputs of the 11 inverters to feed one another so that the output of the last inverter would drive the input of the first inverter (creating an odd‐number inversion ring that oscillates). However, the assignment of the inverter input bus is done incorrectly. Instead of “shifting” the inverter outputs (for example, having inverter0’s input come from inverter10’s output and inverter i’s input come from inverter i–1’s output), the concatenation has been used in such a way that each inverter’s input is tied to its own output. That is, the concatenation “{lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]}” maps lut_ins[10] to lut_outs[10] but then maps lut_ins[9:0] directly to lut_outs[9:0].

Because every inverter ends up having its own output fed back to its input, the inversion effect needed to create oscillation is lost. In simulation this causes the “OUT” signal (driven indirectly from one of these inverter outputs) never to toggle, triggering the error “Ring oscillator output (OUT) never toggled. Likely feedback wiring issue.” 

To fix the problem, the feedback wiring must be corrected so that one inverter’s output drives the next inverter’s input in a ring. In other words, the first inverter’s input should receive the output of the last inverter, and each subsequent inverter’s input should come from the previous inverter’s output. When wired in this proper order, the chain will have an odd number of inversions in the loop, and the ring oscillator will begin toggling as expected.
