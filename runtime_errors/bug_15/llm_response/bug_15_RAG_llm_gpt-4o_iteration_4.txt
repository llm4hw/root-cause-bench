The error message "ERROR: Ring oscillator output (OUT) never toggled. Likely feedback wiring issue." suggests that your ring oscillator is not functioning correctly, meaning the feedback path is not properly causing the oscillation.

Here are the potential issues and solutions:

1. **Feedback Loop Inadequacy**:  
   In the ring oscillator implementation, the feedback loop is critical for making the circuit start oscillating. The way `lut_ins` and `lut_outs` are interconnected is crucial. The assignment `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};` takes `lut_outs[10]` as part of the `lut_ins[0]`. This loop should cause the ring to oscillate. However, if the initial condition doesn't allow oscillations, it will fail. Ensure the initial conditions and propagation are appropriately set.

2. **Initialization Issue**:  
   The way the loop's initial condition is set can prevent the feedback loop from starting to oscillate. When you do `force uut.lut_ins[0] = 1'b1;` and then release after 20 ns, it may not result in a change due to the feedback not settling correctly after this force and release operation.

3. **Latch/Delay Modeling Subtleties**:
   Each inverter introduces a delay of `1ns` (#1 in `not_with_delay`). Since you require toggling, this should create a stable feedback when setup correctly, however, in simulation, all initial states might not propagate well without specific toggling behavior. 

**Solution Approach**:
1. **Check Initial Conditions**: Ensure all `lut_outs` bits are neither all 1s nor all 0s when released to create the necessary changes for oscillation.

2. **Check Inverter Delays & Initial State**: Verify that the delay and initial conditions for each inverter permit normal operation. Instead of forcing `lut_ins[0]` to high and releasing it, consider initializing `lut_ins` to known states that lead to the necessary transitions.

3. **Simulation Tool Behavior**: Sometimes, simulation initialization might need a few cycles to stabilize‚Äîrun it for a few extra cycles to allow for initial noise to set real oscillation.

Here‚Äôs a refined initialization method within your testbench:
```verilog
initial begin
    $display("Testbench started.");

    ICE_CLK = 0;
    enable = 1;
    
    // Power-up spikes to help start oscillation
    uut.lut_outs = 11'b10101010101; // Alternating bits or some known non-uniform state
    #1;
    
    stable_cycles = 0;
    last_out = OUT;
    #20;

    repeat (1000) begin
        #10;
        if (OUT === last_out)
            stable_cycles = stable_cycles + 1;
        else begin
            $display("Ring oscillator is toggling. OUT changed at time %0t ns", $time);
            $finish;
        end
        last_out = OUT;
    end

    $fatal("ERROR: Ring oscillator output (OUT) never toggled. Likely feedback wiring issue.");
end
```

This should facilitate a proper start to the ring oscillator. You might need to adjust `uut.lut_outs` for your specific logic to ensure it doesn't start at a neutral point which guarantees no oscillation.
