The error message you're encountering is due to the "ERROR: Ring oscillator output (OUT) never toggled. Likely feedback wiring issue."

The problem arises from how the ring oscillator's luts are wired in your design. Specifically, the way you assign `lut_ins` using `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};` is not correct. This assignment is supposed to create a feedback loop essential for the operation of a ring oscillator, but it doesn't initiate an oscillation by itself.

### Explanation of Bug:

1. **Feedback Loop Initialization**: Your test bench tries to force `lut_ins[0]` to be `1` at the start, but after releasing it, the feedback within `lut_ins` might not be sufficient to start the oscillations because the feedback loop passes through all `lut_outs` without any initial drive beyond the first one. 

2. **Toggling of OUT**: The feedback around your ring is set up incorrectly, causing `OUT` never to toggle, which is why the `stable_cycles` counter never resets.

### How to Fix the Bug:

1. **Check Initial Conditions**: In a ring oscillator, there should typically be an odd number of inversions or some imbalance to ensure oscillation. You might require ensuring that the inverters within your loop start with proper initial conditions to create an oscillation. Initiate the oscillation with a non-equilibrium input or include an initial state that breaks the feedback equilibrium.

2. **Correct the Wiring of Ring Oscillator**: Ensure the wiring properly represents a feedback loop which typically involves cascading inverters and providing an odd number of inversions in the feedback path.

3. **Enable Feedback Loop**: Make sure the feedback initiated by `lut_outs[10]` directly affects the first element of the loop to perpetuate the oscillation without remaining in a static state.

Make sure all edge cases in your testbench are handled including initializing each state to start the oscillation:

```verilog
initial begin
    $display("Testbench started.");
    
    ICE_CLK = 0;
    enable = 1;

    // Trigger initial oscillation
    repeat (1) begin
        force uut.lut_ins[0] = 1'b0; // Force a state toggle which might help start the oscillation
        #5;
        force uut.lut_ins[0] = 1'b1;
        #5;
        force uut.lut_ins[0] = 1'b0;
    end

    // Continue as is with checking the OUT
    stable_cycles = 0;
    last_out = OUT;
    #20;

    repeat (1000) begin
        #10;
        if (OUT === last_out)
            stable_cycles = stable_cycles + 1;
        else begin
            $display("Ring oscillator is toggling. OUT changed at time %0t ns", $time);
            $finish;
        end
        last_out = OUT;
    end

    $fatal("ERROR: Ring oscillator output (OUT) never toggled. Likely feedback wiring issue.");
end
```

This should help start and maintain the oscillation in your simulation.
