The bug arises from an incorrect feedback connection between the inverters in the ring oscillator. The `lut_ins` assignment `{lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]}` creates multiple independent pairs of inverters (e.g., inverter 0 ↔ 10, 1 ↔ 9, etc.), each forming a loop with two inverters (even number of inversions), which cannot oscillate. Additionally, inverter 5 is connected to itself. This structure results in stable logic levels instead of oscillation. The feedback wiring should form a single chain of 11 inverters (odd number) where each inverter's input connects to the previous inverter's output, with the last feeding back to the first. The incorrect concatenation in `lut_ins` breaks this required chain, causing the output to remain stable.
