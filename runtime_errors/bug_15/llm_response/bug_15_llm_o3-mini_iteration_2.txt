The test‐bench’s error message is reporting that the output signal (which is clocked by the ring inverters’ feedback) never changes state. In other words, despite setting up a closed “ring” of inverters with propagation delays, the simulation eventually shows no oscillation of the puf_clk—and therefore no change in OUT. 

The root cause turns out not to be a “bug” in the simulator but rather a problem in how the feedback loop is initialized. In the design the inverter chain is built with a combinational “always @(*) with a delayed assignment” and the wiring is done by concatenating the inverter outputs back into their inputs. However, because none of the nodes in the closed loop are properly given a defined startup value from the design itself, the simulator tends to resolve the loop to a static value. (A forced signal is applied to one end early in the simulation but then released, and by that time the feedback has already settled.) As a result, even though the inverters have delay, there is no “kick‐off” transient that gets the chain oscillating. Without an initial disturbance or proper initialization, every node stays at the same logic level and no inversion transitions occur. 

Thus the oscillation is “stuck” and puf_clk (and consequently OUT) never sees a rising edge—which is why the test bench complains that the ring oscillator output never toggled.

In summary, the bug occurs because the feedback wiring is “correct” in structure but the ring oscillator is never properly started. The forced condition in the test bench that is meant to initialize one of the nodes is either applied too briefly or in a way that ends up letting the circuit settle to a fixed point. 

To fix the problem one must ensure that the inverter ring is given a proper initial disturbance or one node is initialized so that the combinational loop does not immediately settle into a steady state. (For example, removing or delaying the force on the first node so that the loop “kicks off” from an undefined or non‐steady condition would let the inherent delays produce a periodic oscillation.)
