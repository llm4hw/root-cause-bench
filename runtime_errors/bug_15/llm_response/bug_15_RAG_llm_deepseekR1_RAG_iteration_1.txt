The bug is in the incorrect feedback connection of the ring oscillator's inverters. The `assign` statement for `lut_ins` is improperly structured, causing the inverters to connect in a non-oscillating configuration.

**Why it's occurring:**  
The line `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};` incorrectly connects the inverters. This results in `lut_ins[1]` being connected to `lut_outs[9]` (instead of `lut_outs[0]`), `lut_ins[2]` to `lut_outs[8]`, and so on. This breaks the sequential chain needed for oscillation, as the inverters are not connected in a proper loop (output of inverter0 should feed into inverter1, etc., with the last inverter feeding back to the first).

**Fix:**  
Correct the `assign` statement to ensure each inverter's input is connected to the previous inverter's output, forming a proper ring. Modify the line to:  
```verilog
assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[0], lut_outs[1], lut_outs[2], lut_outs[3], lut_outs[4], lut_outs[5], lut_outs[6], lut_outs[7], lut_outs[8], lut_outs[9]};
```  
This explicitly connects `lut_ins[0]` to `lut_outs[10]` (last inverter) and `lut_ins[1]` to `lut_outs[0]` (first inverter), creating the correct feedback path for oscillation.
