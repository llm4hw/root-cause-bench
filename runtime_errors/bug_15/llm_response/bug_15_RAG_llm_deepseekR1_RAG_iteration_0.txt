The bug in the code is due to an incorrect feedback connection between the inverters in the ring oscillator. 

**Root Cause**:  
The assign statement `assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]};` incorrectly connects each inverter's input to its own output (via `lut_ins = lut_outs`). This creates individual loops for each inverter instead of a chain of inverters. As a result, the ring oscillator cannot start oscillating because there's no proper feedback path through all the inverters.

**Fix**:  
Modify the feedback connection to form a proper ring structure. Each inverter's input should be connected to the output of the previous inverter, with the last inverter's output feeding back to the first inverter's input. 

**Corrected Code**:  
```verilog
assign lut_ins = {lut_outs[9:0], lut_outs[10]}; // Correct feedback connection
```

**Explanation**:  
- The original code used `{lut_outs[10], lut_outs[9:0]}` for `lut_ins`, which is equivalent to `lut_ins = lut_outs`. This caused each inverter to loop back to itself (e.g., inverter 0's input connected to inverter 0's output), preventing oscillation.
- The corrected code `{lut_outs[9:0], lut_outs[10]}` connects:  
  - `lut_ins[0]` (input of inverter 0) to `lut_outs[10]` (output of inverter 10),  
  - `lut_ins[1]` (input of inverter 1) to `lut_outs[0]` (output of inverter 0),  
  - and so on, forming a closed loop through all 11 inverters.  

This ensures the signal propagates through the chain of inverters and sustains oscillation, resolving the "feedback wiring issue" error.
