The bug is due to a **duplicate case item** for `4'h1` in the `case` statement. The first occurrence sets `f = 0`, while the second (unreachable) occurrence sets `f = 1`. Since Verilog executes the **first matching case**, the incorrect `f = 0` is assigned when `x` is `4'h1`. This explains why Test Case 1 (input `x = 1`) fails, expecting `f = 1` but getting `f = 0`. The fix is to remove the duplicate `4'h1` case and ensure each case item is unique.
