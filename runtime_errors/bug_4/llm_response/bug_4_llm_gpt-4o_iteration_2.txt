The error in the code comes from the `case` statement within the `always` block of the `top_module`. The issue arises from the fact that there are duplicate cases for `4'h1`. In the `case` statement:

```verilog
case (x) 
    4'h0: f = 1;
    4'h1: f = 0;
    4'h1: f = 1;
    // ... (other cases)
endcase
```

The value `f` for the `case` when `x` is `4'h1` is specified twice, with `f` assigned `0` first and then `1`. However, in Verilog, when there are duplicate case items, only the first matching case will be executed, and the latter entries will not have any effect. Therefore, when `x` is `4'h1`, the `f` signal is assigned the value `0` based on the first matching entry.

This is why the test bench fails when it checks for `x = 4'h1`, as it expects `f = 1` but receives `f = 0`.

To fix this issue, you need to remove or correct the duplicate case statement for `4'h1` so that there is a single definitive assignment for this case. This will ensure that the correct assigned `f` value is checked according to expected test bench results.
