The bug in the code is that in the `case` statement of the `always @(*)` block in the `top_module`, there are two cases defined for `4'h1`, but the second definition of `4'h1` should actually be `4'h10`. Since `4'h1` and `4'h10` both map to decimal 1, the second assignment to `f` is being chosen instead of the correct one.

This bug occurs because in hexadecimal notation, `4'h1` is equivalent to decimal 1, and the next hexadecimal number is `4'h2`. Therefore, `4'h10` should be used for decimal 1 in this context.

To fix this bug, change the second case statement in the `always @(*)` block from `4'h1` to `4'h10` to correctly assign the value corresponding to decimal 1.
