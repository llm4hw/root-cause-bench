The bug is caused by a **duplicate case item for `4'h1`** in the Verilog case statement. The first occurrence sets `f = 0`, while the second (redundant) occurrence sets `f = 1`. However, Verilog executes only the **first matching case item**, so `f = 0` is incorrectly assigned for input `4'h1`. The test bench expects `f = 1` for this input, leading to a failure.

### Fix:
1. **Remove the duplicate case item for `4'h1`** and ensure the correct value is assigned.
2. **Correct the case item for `4'h1`** to set `f = 1` (matching the test bench's expected value).

### Revised Code:
```verilog
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x,
    output reg f
);
always @(*) begin
    case (x)
        4'h0: f = 1;
        4'h1: f = 1; // Corrected from f=0 to f=1, removed duplicate
        4'h2: f = 0;
        4'h3: f = 0;
        4'h4: f = 1;
        4'h5: f = 1;
        4'h6: f = 1;
        4'h7: f = 0;
        4'h8: f = 0;
        4'h9: f = 0;
        4'ha: f = 0;
        4'hb: f = 0;
        4'hc: f = 1;
        4'hd: f = 0;
        4'he: f = 1;
        4'hf: f = 1;
        default: f = 0;
    endcase
end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- The duplicate `4'h1: f = 1;` was erroneously added after `4'h1: f = 0;`, causing `f = 0` to be applied for `x = 1` (since only the first match is executed).
- By correcting the first `4'h1` case item to `f = 1` and removing the duplicate, the output for `x = 1` aligns with the test bench's expected value (`1`), resolving the error.
