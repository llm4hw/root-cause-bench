The problem is due to the duplicate case labels for the value 1. In the case statement, there are two entries for when the input equals 1â€”with one branch assigning f to 0 and the second assigning f to 1. This duplication causes ambiguous behavior because only one unique case should match a given value. As a result, when x is 1, the simulator selects the first matching branch (which assigns f to 0), while the testbench expects a value of 1.

Because the ordering or selection is ambiguous when there are duplicate case labels, this is causing the simulation error. The fix involves ensuring that each possible value of x appears only once in the case statement so that the intended assignment for x = 1 is unambiguous.

Remember, removing any duplicated case conditions in the design helps ensure that the behavior of the module matches the testbench expectations.
