The bug originates from the top_module code, specifically in the `case` statement within the `always` block. The reason for the error is that two branches within the `case` statement handle the same input value, `4'h1`, which is leading to an incorrect behavior.

Here's the relevant section where the duplication occurs:

```verilog
case (x) 
    4'h0: f = 1;
    4'h1: f = 0;  // Duplicate case entry
    4'h1: f = 1;  // Duplicate case entry
```

The problem here is that there are two separate cases for the value `4'h1`. In the presence of such duplication, the behavior is usually determined by the order of occurrence, meaning the latter won't be reached. This implies that for `x = 4'h1`, `f` gets assigned `0`, which contradicts the expected value `1`.

To fix this issue, you should remove one of the duplicate lines for `4'h1`. Keeping the line that assigns the correct value `1` for `4'h1` based on the expected behavior:

Modified code:
```verilog
case (x) 
    4'h0: f = 1;
    4'h1: f = 1;  // Correct assignment for 4'h1
    4'h2: f = 0;
    4'h3: f = 0;
    4'h4: f = 1;
    4'h5: f = 1;
    4'h6: f = 1;
    4'h7: f = 0;
    4'h8: f = 0;
    4'h9: f = 0;
    4'ha: f = 0;
    4'hb: f = 0;
    4'hc: f = 1;
    4'hd: f = 0;
    4'he: f = 1;
    4'hf: f = 1;
    default: f = 0;
endcase
```

With this correction, the `case` statement does not contain any duplicate keys, and the module should produce the expected output, hence resolving the simulation error.
