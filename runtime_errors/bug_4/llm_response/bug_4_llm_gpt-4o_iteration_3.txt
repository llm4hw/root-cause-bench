The error message indicates that there was an unexpected output for the input case `x = 4'h1`. The testbench expected `f = 1` for this input, but the module produced `f = 0`. This discrepancy points to a problem in the `case` statement in the module.

Upon inspecting the `always` block, the case statement mistakenly defines two cases for `4'h1`:

```verilog
4'h1: f = 0;
4'h1: f = 1;
```

In a `case` statement, having multiple identical case conditions will lead the synthesis tool to prioritize the first instance and ignore the subsequent ones. So when `x` is `4'h1`, `f` will be set to `0`. This is why the output `f` is `0` instead of the expected `1`.

To resolve this issue:

1. Remove one of the duplicated `4'h1` conditions and adjust it to set `f` to the expected value as per the requirements.

The corrected single entry for `4'h1` should reflect what the expected behavior should be, aligning with the specified behavior in the testbench. By ensuring there is only one definition for each case, especially `4'h1`, the intended output `f = 1` will be achieved.
