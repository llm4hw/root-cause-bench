The error is occurring because there is a duplicate case assignment in the `case` statement within the `top_module`. For `4'h1`, the code assigns `f` twice, once to `0` and once to `1`. This creates ambiguity because it is not clear which value should be taken for `x = 4'b0001`.

In Verilog, when there are duplicate case entries, the last case entry that matches the input value is used. Consequently, the `f` = 1 assignment is overriding the `f` = 0 assignment. However, it seems from the testbench that the expected result for `x = 4'b0001` (4'h1) is `1`, but due to the way the `expected_values` is organized, a misunderstanding arose which led to the assertion error.

To fix the issue, you need to remove the duplicate entry and verify the logic of `expected_values`, ensuring it matches the intended functionality of the `case` statement. Here‚Äôs the corrected module:

```verilog
module top_module (
	input [4:1] x,
	output reg f
);

always @(*) begin
		case (x) 
			4'h0: f = 1;
			4'h1: f = 1; // fix this to the correct intended value
			4'h2: f = 0;
			4'h3: f = 0;
			4'h4: f = 1;
			4'h5: f = 1;
			4'h6: f = 1;
			4'h7: f = 0;
			4'h8: f = 0;
			4'h9: f = 0;
			4'ha: f = 0;
			4'hb: f = 0;
			4'hc: f = 1;
			4'hd: f = 0;
			4'he: f = 1;
			4'hf: f = 1;
			default: f = 0;
		endcase
	end

endmodule
```

Ensure that your logic aligns with `expected_values`. If `expected_values` is correct, the change above should resolve the issue. If not, you might need to adjust `expected_values` accordingly.
