The bug is caused by a **duplicate case item** in the Verilog case statement. Specifically, the input `4'h1` is handled twice: first assigning `f = 0`, then `f = 1`. Since Verilog executes the **first matching case**, the second entry (`4'h1: f = 1;`) is unreachable. This leads to an incorrect value of `f = 0` when `x = 4'h1`, which fails Test Case 1 (expecting `f = 1`). The duplicate case item must be removed, and the intended value for each input must be uniquely defined.
