The error in the code arises from a duplicate case in the `always` block of the `top_module`. Specifically, the case value `4'h1` is listed twice, with conflicting assignments:

```verilog
4'h1: f = 0;
4'h1: f = 1;
```
This means that for input `x = 0001`, the assignment to `f` is ambiguous, as it is attempted to be set to both `0` and `1`, which is incorrect.

In the context of the error message from the simulation: 

- The test bench checks the output for `x = 1` and expects `f` to be `1`. However, due to the duplicate `4'h1` case assignment in the code, `f` is being set to `0` as that's the first assignment encountered for `4'h1`. This doesn't match the expected value in the test bench, which leads to the error.

**Fix:**

Remove the duplicate `4'h1` case and make sure `f` is correctly set to `1` for `x = 0001`. The corrected section of the `case` statement should look like this:

```verilog
4'h0: f = 1;
4'h1: f = 1; // Corrected to set 'f' to 1 as expected
4'h2: f = 0;
4'h3: f = 0;
```

By making this correction, your simulation should proceed without errors for input test case `x = 1`, as it will now correctly set `f` to `1`.
