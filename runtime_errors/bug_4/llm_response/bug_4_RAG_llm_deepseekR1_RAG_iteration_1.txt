The bug in the code is due to a **duplicate case statement entry** for `4'h1`. The first occurrence sets `f = 0`, while the second (duplicate) entry sets `f = 1`. Verilog uses the **first matching case**, so for input `x = 4'h1`, the output `f` is incorrectly set to `0` (from the first match) instead of the expected `1`.

### Error Analysis:
- **Test Case 1** (input `x = 4'h1`) triggers the duplicate case. The testbench expects `f = 1` (from `expected_values[14]`), but the code outputs `f = 0` because the first `4'h1` case is executed.
- The duplicate case (`4'h1: f = 1;`) is a typo and should be removed or corrected.

### Fix:
**Remove the first incorrect case entry `4'h1: f = 0;`** to ensure the correct output for `x = 4'h1`:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    case (x) 
        4'h0: f = 1;
        // Remove the duplicate line: 4'h1: f = 0;
        4'h1: f = 1; // Correct value for x=4'h1
        4'h2: f = 0;
        4'h3: f = 0;
        ... // Rest of the cases remain unchanged
    endcase
end
```

### Explanation:
- The duplicate case caused `x = 4'h1` to erroneously assign `f = 0`.
- By removing the first `4'h1: f = 0;` line, the correct case (`4'h1: f = 1;`) takes effect, aligning the output with the testbench's expected value. This resolves the timing error for Test Case 1.
