The bug is that the case statement has duplicate entries for 4'h1. In your code, there are two cases for when x equals 1:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ 4'h1: f = 0;  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ 4'h1: f = 1;

Verilog‚Äôs case statement will match the first occurrence it finds. In this situation, when the input is 1 the simulator uses the first branch and assigns f = 0, even though the test bench expected f to be 1. This discrepancy between the two assignments for x = 1 is why the test case fails.

To fix the issue, remove or correct the duplicate case value so that the value for x = 1 is unique and is assigned f = 1 (or whichever value you actually intend for that case). For example, if the expected functionality is to have f equal to 1 when x is 1, modify the case statement to have only the correct assignment for that value:

-------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x,
    output reg f
);

always @(*) begin
    case (x) 
        4'h0: f = 1;
        4'h1: f = 1;  // Use the intended assignment for 1
        4'h2: f = 0;
        4'h3: f = 0;
        4'h4: f = 1;
        4'h5: f = 1;
        4'h6: f = 1;
        4'h7: f = 0;
        4'h8: f = 0;
        4'h9: f = 0;
        4'ha: f = 0;
        4'hb: f = 0;
        4'hc: f = 1;
        4'hd: f = 0;
        4'he: f = 1;
        4'hf: f = 1;
        default: f = 0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

Now, when the input is 1, f will be set to 1 as expected, and your test bench should pass.
