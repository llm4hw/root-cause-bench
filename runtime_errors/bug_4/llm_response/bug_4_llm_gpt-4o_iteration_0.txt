The issue revolves around the `case` statement inside the `always @(*)` block in the `top_module`. Specifically, there's a duplication in the case values being used to control the output `f`. Here's a breakdown of the problem:

1. **Duplicate Case Values:**
   - The case value `4'h1` is listed twice in the `case` statement. The first occurrence assigns `f = 0;`, while the second assigns `f = 1;`. In a `case` statement, each case value should be unique. When duplicates are present, only the first occurrence is used, and the second is ignored by the simulator/logic synthesis tool.

2. **Effect on the Simulation:**
   - Because the first `4'h1` case sets `f = 0`, the intended behavior for `x = 4'h1`, which should set `f = 1` as per the test bench expectation (`expected_values`), does not occur. This discrepancy leads to the failure of test case 1.

3. **Potential Fix:**
   - Remove the duplicate case value. Ensure that only one case is present for each possible input value. In this specific situation, deciding which value to keep (or whether to prioritize the first or second entry) is essential to achieve the desired functionality.

Remember, handling such issues gracefully is crucial for ensuring the correct behavior of digital circuits and simulations. The occurrence of duplicate case values should always be checked during code reviews or debugging sessions.
