The bug is caused by a duplicate `4'h1` case item in the `case` statement. Verilog executes the **first matching** case item and exits the case block. The second `4'h1` case (intended to set `f=1`) is never reached because the first `4'h1` case (setting `f=0`) takes precedence. This leads to an incorrect output of `0` for input `x=4'h1` (Test Case 1). The duplicate `4'h1` is likely a typo and should be replaced with the correct case value (e.g., another hex digit like `4'h3`).
