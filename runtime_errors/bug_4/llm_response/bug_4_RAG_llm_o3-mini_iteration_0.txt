The problem is that the case statement contains a duplicate branch for the value 4'h1. Notice that 4'h1 appears twice:

  • 4'h1: f = 0;
  • 4'h1: f = 1;

When the simulator encounters an input of 4'h1, it matches the first branch and assigns f = 0, which is not what the test bench expects (the expected value is 1). In a case statement, once a matching case is found, the subsequent cases aren’t evaluated. This is why Test Case 1 fails.

To fix the bug, remove (or merge) the duplicate so that 4'h1 is only assigned the correct value (f = 1). For example, change the case statement to:

  case (x)
   4'h0: f = 1;
   // Remove the incorrect/duplicate branch for 4'h1
   4'h1: f = 1;
   4'h2: f = 0;
   4'h3: f = 0;
   4'h4: f = 1;
   4'h5: f = 1;
   4'h6: f = 1;
   4'h7: f = 0;
   4'h8: f = 0;
   4'h9: f = 0;
   4'ha: f = 0;
   4'hb: f = 0;
   4'hc: f = 1;
   4'hd: f = 0;
   4'he: f = 1;
   4'hf: f = 1;
   default: f = 0;
  endcase

With this correction, when x is 4'h1, the simulation will find the unique branch and assign f the value of 1 as expected.
