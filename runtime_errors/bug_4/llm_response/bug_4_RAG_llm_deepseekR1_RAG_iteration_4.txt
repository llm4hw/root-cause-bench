The bug in the Verilog code is a **duplicate case item for `4'h1`** in the `case` statement. 

- **Why it's occurring**: The `case` statement has two entries for `4'h1`. The first entry sets `f = 0`, but the second entry (intended for `4'h1`) sets `f = 1`. In Verilog, **only the first matching case item is executed**, so when `x = 4'h1`, the first entry (`f = 0`) is used, leading to an incorrect output. The testbench expects `f = 1` for this input (as per `expected_values[14] = 1`), causing the error.

- **Fix**: Remove the erroneous first `4'h1` case item. The corrected `case` block should look like this:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
  case (x)
    4'h0: f = 1;
    // Remove the duplicate line: 4'h1: f = 0;
    4'h1: f = 1; // This is the correct entry for 4'h1
    4'h2: f = 0;
    4'h3: f = 0;
    ... // Rest of the case items remain unchanged
  endcase
end
```

This ensures the correct value (`f = 1`) is assigned when `x = 4'h1`, aligning with the testbench's expectations. The duplicate entry was likely a typo, and removing it resolves the conflict.
