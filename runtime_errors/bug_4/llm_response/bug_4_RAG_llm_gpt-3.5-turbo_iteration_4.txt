The bug in your code is that you have duplicate case values in your case statement inside the `always @(*)` block of your `top_module`. This can cause unexpected behavior and errors in simulation.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that each case value in your case statement is unique. In your current code, you have two cases with the value 4'h1, which is causing the error message you are seeing during simulation.

Here is the corrected code for the `top_module` with unique case values:

```verilog
module top_module (
    input [4:1] x,
    output reg f
);

always @(*) begin
    case (x) 
        4'h0: f = 1;
        4'h1: f = 0;
        4'h2: f = 0;
        4'h3: f = 0;
        4'h4: f = 1;
        4'h5: f = 1;
        4'h6: f = 1;
        4'h7: f = 0;
        4'h8: f = 0;
        4'h9: f = 0;
        4'ha: f = 0;
        4'hb: f = 0;
        4'hc: f = 1;
        4'hd: f = 0;
        4'he: f = 1;
        4'hf: f = 1;
        default: f = 0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

By ensuring that each case value is unique, you should now be able to simulate your test bench without encountering errors related to duplicate case values.
