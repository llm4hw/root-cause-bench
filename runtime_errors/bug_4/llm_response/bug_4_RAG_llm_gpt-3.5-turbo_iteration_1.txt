The bug in the code is due to having duplicate case values in the case statement within the `always @(*)` block of the `top_module` module. Specifically, you have `4'h1` repeated twice. When this happens, the simulator will use the last match found in the case statement, so even though `4'h1` is matched twice, the second assignment (`f = 1;`) will override the first one (`f = 0;`).

To fix this issue, ensure that each case value in the case statement is unique. Remove or correct the duplicate case values to have a valid case statement. For example, you can change the duplicate `4'h1` to a different value like `4'hA`.

Here is the corrected code snippet for the case statement:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    case (x) 
        4'h0: f = 1;
        4'h1: f = 0;
        4'hA: f = 1;   // Changed from 4'h1 to 4'hA
        4'h2: f = 0;
        // Add the rest of the cases as needed
        default: f = 0;
    endcase
end
```

After making this change, simulate the code again to verify that the error no longer occurs.
