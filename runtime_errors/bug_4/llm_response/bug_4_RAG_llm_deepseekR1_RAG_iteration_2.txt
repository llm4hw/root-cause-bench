The bug in the Verilog code is caused by a **duplicate case statement for input `4'h1`**, leading to incorrect output for that specific input. 

### Root Cause:
- In the `case` statement, there are two entries for `4'h1`:
  ```verilog
  4'h1: f = 0; // First (incorrect) entry
  4'h1: f = 1; // Second (intended) entry
  ```
- Verilog executes the **first matching** `case` item and exits. The first `4'h1` sets `f = 0`, and the second is unreachable. This causes the output `f` to be `0` for `x = 1` instead of the expected `1`.

### Fix:
**Remove the first erroneous `4'h1` entry** to ensure the correct value is assigned for `x = 1`. Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    case (x) 
        4'h0: f = 1;
        // Remove the duplicate 4'h1: f = 0;
        4'h1: f = 1;
        4'h2: f = 0;
        4'h3: f = 0;
        4'h4: f = 1;
        ... // Rest of the case items remain unchanged
    endcase
end
```

### Explanation:
- The duplicate `4'h1` caused `f` to be set to `0` erroneously. By removing the first occurrence, `x = 1` now triggers `4'h1: f = 1`, matching the test bench's expected value. This resolves the timing error and ensures the truth table is implemented correctly.
