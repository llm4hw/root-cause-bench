The problem is that the case statement contains two entries for the input value 1 (4'h1). When the simulator encounters the duplicate, it only uses the first occurrence, so when x equals 1, f is assigned 0 instead of the expected value of 1. This conflict is causing the test bench to report an error (Test Case 1 failed).

The duplicate case label means that your case statement is ambiguous for x = 1; the simulator doesn't merge the two definitions. Instead, it only applies the first match it sees (f = 0), which conflicts with the expected behavior (f should be 1). 

To resolve the issue, you need to remove or correct the duplicate entry so that each possible input value has exactly one unique case label with the intended assignment for f.
