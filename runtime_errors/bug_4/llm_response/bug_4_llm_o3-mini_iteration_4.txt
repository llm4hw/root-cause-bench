The problem is that the case statement in the module contains two branches for the same input value (4'h1). In other words, there are duplicate labels for when x equals 1. The test bench is expecting that, for an input value of 1, f should be 1 based on the second instance. However, since the first occurrence (which assigns f a value of 0) is encountered first in the case statement, only that assignment is used when x is 1. This duplicate entry causes a logical error because the simulator takes the first match it finds, leaving the later (correct) assignment ineffective.

This bug occurs because duplicate case entries cause ambiguity and inconsistent behavior. In this case, the first branch (f = 0) is executed when x is 1, which conflicts with what the test bench expects (f = 1). 

To fix this bug, you need to remove or correct the duplicate label so that each input value is handled only once with the intended assignment.
