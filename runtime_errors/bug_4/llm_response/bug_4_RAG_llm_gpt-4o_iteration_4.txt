The bug in the code is due to a duplicate case value in the `case` statement within the `always` block of the `top_module`. You have defined two different assignments for the same input, `4'h1`. Specifically, these lines:

```verilog
4'h1: f = 0;
4'h1: f = 1;
```

The problem arises because case statements do not allow duplicate entries, and the simulator uses the first occurrence of the `4'h1` case, which assigns `f = 0`. This is why you are getting the error message: `ERROR: Test Case 1 failed. f = 0 (Expected: 1)`.

To fix this issue, you need to remove or correct the duplicate case entry. Decide whether the desired output for `4'h1` is indeed `0` or `1`. If it is `1`, change the case statement accordingly:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    case (x) 
        4'h0: f = 1;
        4'h1: f = 1;    // Fixing the duplicate issue by setting the desired output
        4'h2: f = 0;
        4'h3: f = 0;
        4'h4: f = 1;
        4'h5: f = 1;
        4'h6: f = 1;
        4'h7: f = 0;
        4'h8: f = 0;
        4'h9: f = 0;
        4'ha: f = 0;
        4'hb: f = 0;
        4'hc: f = 1;
        4'hd: f = 0;
        4'he: f = 1;
        4'hf: f = 1;
        default: f = 0;
    endcase
end
```

With this correction, the expected behavior for all test cases should be achieved, and the error should be resolved.
