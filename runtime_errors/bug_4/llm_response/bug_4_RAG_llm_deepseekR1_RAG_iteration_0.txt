The bug in the code is caused by a **duplicate case item** for `4'h1` in the `case` statement. Verilog requires each case item to be unique, and having two entries for the same value (`4'h1`) leads to undefined behavior. Most simulators will use the **last duplicate entry**, but some may use the first, causing unexpected results. 

In the provided code, the first entry for `4'h1` sets `f = 0`, and the second sets `f = 1`. However, the testbench expects `f = 1` for input `x = 1` (as per `expected_values`). The duplicate entry likely caused the simulator to use the first occurrence (`f = 0`), resulting in the error.

### Fix:
**Remove the duplicate `4'h1: f = 0;` line** from the `case` statement. Here's the corrected code section:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    case (x) 
        4'h0: f = 1;
        // Remove the duplicate line: 4'h1: f = 0;
        4'h1: f = 1;
        4'h2: f = 0;
        4'h3: f = 0;
        ... // Rest of the case items remain unchanged
    endcase
end
```

### Explanation:
- The duplicate `4'h1` entry caused conflicting assignments for `f`.
- Removing the erroneous line ensures `f = 1` for `x = 1`, aligning with the testbench's expectation (`expected_values[14] = 1` for `i = 1`).
- The remaining case items now correctly map to the truth table described in Fig. 5.4.
