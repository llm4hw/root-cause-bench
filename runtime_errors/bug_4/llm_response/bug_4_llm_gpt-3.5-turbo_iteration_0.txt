In the provided code, the bug lies in the logic of the `case` statement in the `always @(*)` block of the `top_module` module. The issue is that there are duplicated case statements for some values of `x`. Specifically, both `4'h1` and `4'h5` are assigned the value 1, which is incorrect. This is causing a discrepancy between the expected values computed in the testbench and the actual values generated by the module's logic. 

To fix this bug and ensure the correct functionality of the module, you should make sure that each unique value of `x` has a distinct assignment in the `case` statement, without any duplicates. In this case, you should revise the duplicate assignment for `4'h5` to match the expected value of 0.

After fixing the duplicate assignment issue, the code should be tested again to verify that the module produces the expected outputs for each input value as defined in the testbench.
