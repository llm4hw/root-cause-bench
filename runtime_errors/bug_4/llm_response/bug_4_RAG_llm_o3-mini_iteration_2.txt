The bug is caused by having duplicate case entries for the value 4'h1. In your case statement you list 4'h1 twice with conflicting assignments:

  4'h1: f = 0;  
  4'h1: f = 1;

When the input x is 4'h1 (i.e., the decimal value 1), the case statement will match the first occurrence and set f to 0. However, your testbench expects f to be 1 for that input. This conflict is the root cause of the error message from the test bench.

To fix the bug, you need to remove the duplicate case for 4'h1 and ensure that only one entry is specified for each value. For example, if the intended output for 4'h1 is 1, then remove the erroneous entry assigning it 0:

  // Corrected version  
  case (x)  
    4'h0: f = 1;  
    4'h1: f = 1;  
    4'h2: f = 0;  
    4'h3: f = 0;  
    4'h4: f = 1;  
    4'h5: f = 1;  
    4'h6: f = 1;  
    4'h7: f = 0;  
    4'h8: f = 0;  
    4'h9: f = 0;  
    4'ha: f = 0;  
    4'hb: f = 0;  
    4'hc: f = 1;  
    4'hd: f = 0;  
    4'he: f = 1;  
    4'hf: f = 1;  
    default: f = 0;  
  endcase

This change aligns the behavior of your module with the expectations of your test bench, thereby resolving the error.
