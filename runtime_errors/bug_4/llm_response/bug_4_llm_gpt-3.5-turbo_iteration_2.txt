The bug in the provided code is due to duplicated cases in the `case` statement in the `always` block of the `top_module`. Specifically, there are two cases for `4'h1`, which can lead to confusion and incorrect behavior. 

The duplication of cases can cause the output `f` to be assigned the wrong value for some input values. This scenario results in the test case failing because the expected output does not match the actual output due to the incorrect case assignments.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that each input value (`x`) in the `case` statement is unique and has only one corresponding assignment to `f`. Remove or reassign the duplicated case `4'h1` to address this issue. 

After making this modification, verify the correctness by simulating the testbench to confirm that the test cases now pass without any errors, providing the expected output for each input value `x`.
