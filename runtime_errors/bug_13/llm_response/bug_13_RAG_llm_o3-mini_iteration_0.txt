The problem is that the carry–chain of the 4‑bit full adder is wired out‐of-sequence. In a ripple–carry adder the carry output from one bit must feed directly into the next bit’s carry input; however, in the full_add_4bit module the wires connecting the instances are mixed up. For example:

• The output carry from the first bit (fa1) is assigned to w_carry1, but then the second bit (fa2) uses w_carry3 as its carry input (instead of w_carry1).

• Similarly, fa3 takes its carry input from w_carry1 (the first bit’s carry) when it should be using the carry from fa2, and fa4’s carry input comes from w_carry2 when it should come from the previous stage’s output.

Because the carry signals are connected in the wrong order, the overall addition produces an incorrect result (for instance, 3 + 5 should equal 8, but with the wrong carry chain the test bench sees “10010” instead of “01000”).

To fix this, re‑wire the chain so that the carry output of one full adder feeds directly into the carry input of the next. One correct approach is:

 • fa1: i_cin = i_cin, o_carry → w_carry1  
 • fa2: i_cin = w_carry1, o_carry → w_carry2  
 • fa3: i_cin = w_carry2, o_carry → w_carry3  
 • fa4: i_cin = w_carry3, o_carry → o_carry (final carry)

Making these changes will ensure that the ripple carry adder works as intended and the expected addition results are obtained.

Structural model of a full adder using two half adders
Example 4.10 shows the structural model of a 4-bit ripple carry adder in Verilog. The RCA is created
by instantiating four full adders. Notice that a logic 1’b0 can be directly inserted into the port map of the
ﬁrst full adder to model the behavior of C0 ¼ 0.

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: The ability to implement the carry out logic using the expression Cout ¼ AB + (A  B)Cin allows us to
implement a full adder with two half adders and the addition of a single OR gate. Example 4.7 shows this
approach. In this new conﬁguration, the sum is produced in two levels of logic while the carry out is
produced in three levels of logic.
