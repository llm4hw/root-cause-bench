The bug in the code is related to an incorrect computation in the check task inside the testbench. The way the expected sum is calculated is not considering carry-out correctly.

To fix this issue, you need to modify the calculation of the expected sum in the check task. Currently, the calculation is simply adding the numbers a, b, and cin, but it should consider the carry-out from the full adder. Here is how you can fix it:

Change this line:
```expected = a_t + b_t + cin_t;```

To this:
```expected = a_t + b_t + cin_t; // Calculate the simple sum
expected = expected % 16; // Apply modulus to consider the 4-bit limitation
expected = {expected[3], expected[2:0]}; // Reorder the bits if necessary```

By adding the modulus operation and reordering the bits, you can ensure that the expected value considers the correct output given the 4-bit limitation.

A full adder is a circuit that still produces a sum and carry out, but considers three inputs in the

Structural model of a full adder using two half adders
Example 4.10 shows the structural model of a 4-bit ripple carry adder in Verilog. The RCA is created
by instantiating four full adders. Notice that a logic 1’b0 can be directly inserted into the port map of the
ﬁrst full adder to model the behavior of C0 ¼ 0.

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: The ability to implement the carry out logic using the expression Cout ¼ AB + (A  B)Cin allows us to
implement a full adder with two half adders and the addition of a single OR gate. Example 4.7 shows this
approach. In this new conﬁguration, the sum is produced in two levels of logic while the carry out is
produced in three levels of logic.
