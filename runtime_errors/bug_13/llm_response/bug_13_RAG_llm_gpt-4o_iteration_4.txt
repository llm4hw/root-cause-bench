The error message "ERROR: a=3, b=5, cin=0 -> Expected 01000, got 10010" indicates a problem with the 4-bit full adder module `full_add_4bit`. Let's break down the situation:

- The expected result for `a = 3 (0011)`, `b = 5 (0101)`, and `cin = 0` is `sum = 8 (1000)`.
- The output of the test bench showed a result of `10010`, which indicates a 5-bit value due to an incorrect propagation of carry.

Looking into the `full_add_4bit` module, the problem arises from incorrect wiring of the carry outputs between the full adder instances `fa1`, `fa2`, `fa3`, and `fa4`. Here's the error:

1. **Carry Output Ordering**:
   - The carry connections between the full adders are incorrect.
   - `fa2` should use `w_carry1` as `i_cin` instead of `w_carry3`.
   - `fa3` should use `w_carry2` as `i_cin` instead of `w_carry1`.
   - `fa4` should use `w_carry3` as `i_cin`.

To fix this, update the carry connections in the code:

```verilog
full_half_add_1bit fa1(
    .i_a(i_a[0]),
    .i_b(i_b[0]),
    .i_cin(i_cin),
    .o_sum(o_sum[0]),
    .o_carry(w_carry1)
),
fa2(
    .i_a(i_a[1]),
    .i_b(i_b[1]),
    .i_cin(w_carry1),  // Correct carry-in
    .o_sum(o_sum[1]),
    .o_carry(w_carry2)
),
fa3(
    .i_a(i_a[2]),
    .i_b(i_b[2]),
    .i_cin(w_carry2),  // Correct carry-in
    .o_sum(o_sum[2]),
    .o_carry(w_carry3)
),
fa4(
    .i_a(i_a[3]),
    .i_b(i_b[3]),
    .i_cin(w_carry3),  // Correct carry-in
    .o_sum(o_sum[3]),
    .o_carry(o_carry)
);
```

By correcting these carry chain connections, each adder will correctly propagate the carry to the next significant bit position, ensuring the proper output sum and correct final carry output. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected result.

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: The ability to implement the carry out logic using the expression Cout ¼ AB + (A  B)Cin allows us to
implement a full adder with two half adders and the addition of a single OR gate. Example 4.7 shows this
approach. In this new conﬁguration, the sum is produced in two levels of logic while the carry out is
produced in three levels of logic.
