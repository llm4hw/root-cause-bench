The bug in the code arises from incorrect connections between the carry signals in the 4-bit full adder module. The carry-out of each full adder is not properly connected to the carry-in of the next higher bit, causing incorrect propagation of the carry and erroneous results.

**Why it occurs:**
- In the original `full_add_4bit` module, the carry signals are misrouted:
  - `fa2` incorrectly takes its carry-in (`i_cin`) from `w_carry3` (the carry-out of `fa4`), creating a loop.
  - `fa3` takes its carry-in from `w_carry1` (carry-out of `fa1`), skipping `fa2`.
  - `fa4` takes its carry-in from `w_carry2` (carry-out of `fa2`), and its carry-out is not connected to the final output (`o_carry` is erroneously taken from `fa3`).
- This breaks the ripple carry chain, leading to incorrect sum and carry values.

**Fix:**
Correct the carry chain to sequentially connect the carry-out of each full adder to the carry-in of the next. Update the `full_add_4bit` module as follows:

```verilog
module full_add_4bit(
    input  [3:0] i_a, i_b,
    input        i_cin,
    output [3:0] o_sum,
    output       o_carry
);
    wire w_carry1, w_carry2, w_carry3;

    full_half_add_1bit fa1(
        .i_a(i_a[0]),
        .i_b(i_b[0]),
        .i_cin(i_cin),
        .o_sum(o_sum[0]),
        .o_carry(w_carry1)
    );
    full_half_add_1bit fa2(
        .i_a(i_a[1]),
        .i_b(i_b[1]),
        .i_cin(w_carry1),
        .o_sum(o_sum[1]),
        .o_carry(w_carry2)
    );
    full_half_add_1bit fa3(
        .i_a(i_a[2]),
        .i_b(i_b[2]),
        .i_cin(w_carry2),
        .o_sum(o_sum[2]),
        .o_carry(w_carry3)
    );
    full_half_add_1bit fa4(
        .i_a(i_a[3]),
        .i_b(i_b[3]),
        .i_cin(w_carry3),
        .o_sum(o_sum[3]),
        .o_carry(o_carry)
    );
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- The corrected code properly chains the carry-out of each full adder (`w_carry1`, `w_carry2`, `w_carry3`) to the carry-in of the next higher bit.
- The final carry-out (`o_carry`) now comes from the fourth full adder (`fa4`), ensuring correct ripple-carry behavior.
- This fixes the adder's logic, allowing proper calculation of sums and carry flags.

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: The ability to implement the carry out logic using the expression Cout ¼ AB + (A  B)Cin allows us to
implement a full adder with two half adders and the addition of a single OR gate. Example 4.7 shows this
approach. In this new conﬁguration, the sum is produced in two levels of logic while the carry out is
produced in three levels of logic.
