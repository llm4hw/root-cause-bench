The error occurs due to incorrect carry signal connections between the full adder modules in the 4-bit ripple carry adder. Specifically, the carry-out of one stage is not properly connected to the carry-in of the next stage, creating a broken carry chain.

**Root Cause**:  
In the `full_add_4bit` module:
1. `fa2` incorrectly uses `w_carry3` (from `fa4`) as its carry-in instead of `w_carry1` (from `fa1`).
2. `fa3` incorrectly uses `w_carry1` (from `fa1`) as its carry-in instead of `w_carry2` (from `fa2`).
3. The final carry-out (`o_carry`) is taken from `fa3` instead of `fa4`.

**Fix**:  
Reconnect the carry signals sequentially and assign the final carry-out from the last adder stage (`fa4`):

```verilog
// Corrected full_add_4bit module
module full_add_4bit(
    input  [3:0] i_a, i_b,
    input        i_cin,
    output [3:0] o_sum,
    output       o_carry
);
    wire w_carry1, w_carry2, w_carry3;

    full_half_add_1bit fa1(
        .i_a(i_a[0]), .i_b(i_b[0]), .i_cin(i_cin),
        .o_sum(o_sum[0]), .o_carry(w_carry1)
    );
    full_half_add_1bit fa2(
        .i_a(i_a[1]), .i_b(i_b[1]), .i_cin(w_carry1),  // Fixed
        .o_sum(o_sum[1]), .o_carry(w_carry2)
    );
    full_half_add_1bit fa3(
        .i_a(i_a[2]), .i_b(i_b[2]), .i_cin(w_carry2),  // Fixed
        .o_sum(o_sum[2]), .o_carry(w_carry3)
    );
    full_half_add_1bit fa4(
        .i_a(i_a[3]), .i_b(i_b[3]), .i_cin(w_carry3),  // Fixed
        .o_sum(o_sum[3]), .o_carry(o_carry)            // Final carry from fa4
    );
endmodule
```

**Explanation**:  
- The corrected code ensures the carry propagates sequentially: `fa1 → fa2 → fa3 → fa4`.
- The final carry-out (`o_carry`) now comes from the most significant bit (`fa4`), as required for a 4-bit adder.
- This fixes the erroneous carry logic, allowing proper ripple-carry addition.

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: The ability to implement the carry out logic using the expression Cout ¼ AB + (A  B)Cin allows us to
implement a full adder with two half adders and the addition of a single OR gate. Example 4.7 shows this
approach. In this new conﬁguration, the sum is produced in two levels of logic while the carry out is
produced in three levels of logic.
