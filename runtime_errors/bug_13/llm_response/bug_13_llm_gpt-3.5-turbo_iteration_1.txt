The bug in the code is caused by the incorrect instantiation of the full adders in the `full_add_4bit` module. The interconnections between the full adders are incorrect, leading to an incorrect carry propagation mechanism.

The bug occurs because the `w_carry1`, `w_carry2`, and `w_carry3` wires are not properly connected in the `full_add_4bit` module. In the instantiation of `fa2`, the `i_cin` input is connected to `w_carry3`, which is incorrect as it should be connected to `w_carry1`. This mistake propagates through the subsequent full adder instantiations and results in incorrect carry propagation, leading to incorrect sums.

To fix this bug, make sure to correctly connect the carry wires between the full adder instances in the `full_add_4bit` module. Update the connections in the instantiations of `fa2`, `fa3`, and `fa4` to ensure proper carry propagation between the full adders. Once the connections are corrected, simulate the code again to verify that the expected results are obtained.
