The error arises due to two main issues in the 4-bit adder's carry chain:

1. **Incorrect Carry Connections Between Adders**: 
   - The carry signals between the 1-bit full adders are improperly connected, creating a non-sequential chain. For example:
     - `fa2`'s input carry (`i_cin`) incorrectly uses `w_carry3` (from `fa4`), creating a backward loop.
     - `fa3`'s input carry uses `w_carry1` (from `fa1`), skipping the intermediate adder (`fa2`).
   - This breaks the ripple-carry mechanism, causing incorrect propagation of intermediate carries.

2. **Final Carry Output Taken from Wrong Stage**:
   - The module's output carry (`o_carry`) is connected to `fa3`'s carry-out instead of the last adder (`fa4`). This means the final carry reflects the third bit's result, not the fourth (MSB).

**Why This Causes the Error**:
- In the test case `3 + 5 + 0`, the broken carry chain leads to incorrect sum bits and an invalid carry-out. For example, the first adder's carry isn't passed to the second adder, and the loop between `fa2` and `fa4` creates unresolved dependencies, resulting in erroneous values.

**Fix**:
- Reconnect the carry signals to form a proper ripple chain: `fa1 → fa2 → fa3 → fa4`, where each stage's carry-out feeds the next stage's carry-in.
- Connect the final `o_carry` to the carry-out of `fa4` (the last stage), ensuring it reflects the MSB addition's result.
