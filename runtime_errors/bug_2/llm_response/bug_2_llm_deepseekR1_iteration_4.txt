The bug occurs because the output `q` is assigned `a & 0`, which forces the result to always be 0 regardless of input `a`. The testbench expects `q` to be 1 when both inputs `a` and `b` are 1 (Test Case 4), but the current logic ignores input `b` entirely and uses a hardcoded `0` instead. The root cause is a typo in the expression where `b` is erroneously replaced with `0`, leading to incorrect AND logic. To fix this, the `0` in the assignment should be replaced with `b` to properly compute the AND of both inputs.
