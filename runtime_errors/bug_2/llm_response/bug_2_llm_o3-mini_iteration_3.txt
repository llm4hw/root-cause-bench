The problem lies in the assignment statement inside the module. Instead of combining both inputs, the code uses an expression that ANDs input a with a constant zero. Since any value ANDed with zero always results in zero, q never becomes 1 even when both a and b are high. This is why Test Case 4 fails; the test expects q to become 1 when both controllers are on, but the logic forces it to always remain 0.
