The issue is with the assignment statement inside the top module. The output q is defined as the bitwise AND of input a and the constant 0. Because of this, no matter what the inputs are—even when both controllers are on—the result will always be 0. The bug occurs because the module uses a constant zero instead of combining the two actual inputs (or using the appropriate logic operation) as intended.

Since the testbench expects q to be 1 when both inputs a and b are 1, using a constant 0 causes Test Case 4 to fail. To fix the problem, the assignment should be modified so that it correctly incorporates the second input rather than just using a zero constant.
