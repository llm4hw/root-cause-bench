The bug is in the assignment of q in the top_module. Currently, the code assigns q as:

  assign q = a & 0;

This means that regardless of the value of a (or b), q will always be 0 because any bit ANDed with 0 is 0. In Test Case 4, when both a and b are 1, the expected output is 1, but since q is hardwired to 0 (because of the & 0 operation), the test fails.

To fix the bug, you should change the assignment to correctly perform the AND operation between a and b:

  assign q = a & b;

This will allow q to be 1 when both a and b are 1 and 0 otherwise, matching the test bench expectations.

In the past test bench examples, the input and output values are observed using either the
