The bug occurs because the output `q` is assigned the result of `a & 0`, which always evaluates to `0` regardless of `a`'s value. The expression completely ignores input `b`, which is required by the test cases to control the output. Specifically, Test Case 4 expects `q = 1` when both `a` and `b` are `1`, but the current logic hardcodes a `0` instead of using `b`. The fix involves using both inputs `a` and `b` in the logic, such as computing `a & b` instead of `a & 0`.
