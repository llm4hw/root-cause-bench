The error is occurring because of an incorrect assignment in the Verilog module `top_module`. The line:

```verilog
assign q = a&0;
```

always results in `q` being assigned the value `0`, regardless of the values of `a` or `b`. This is because any value of `a` logically ANDed with `0` results in `0`. Hence, even when both controllers `a` and `b` are on (i.e., both `a` and `b` are `1`), `q` will still be `0`, causing Test Case 4 to fail since it expects `q` to be `1`.

To fix the issue, you need to modify the logic in `top_module` so that `q` becomes `1` when both `a` and `b` are `1`. The corrected line should reflect the intended logic, likely involving both `a` and `b`:

```verilog
assign q = a & b;
```

This line ensures that `q` is `1` only when both `a` and `b` are `1`, matching the requirement for Test Case 4 and making it consistent with the test bench expectations.
