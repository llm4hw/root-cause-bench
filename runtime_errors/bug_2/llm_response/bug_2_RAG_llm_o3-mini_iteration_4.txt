The bug is in the logic assignment in the module. The line

  assign q = a & 0;

always results in q being 0, regardless of the values of a or b. The test bench expects q to be 1 when both a and b are 1, but since a is being ANDed with 0 (which always produces 0), q never becomes 1.

To fix the error, change the assignment so that q reflects the logical AND of a and b. The corrected line is:

  assign q = a & b;

With this change, when both a and b are 1, q will be 1, and the test bench will pass.

In the past test bench examples, the input and output values are observed using either the
waveform or listing tool within the simulator tool. It is also useful to print the values of the simulation to
a transcript window to track the simulation as each statement is processed. Messages can be printed...
