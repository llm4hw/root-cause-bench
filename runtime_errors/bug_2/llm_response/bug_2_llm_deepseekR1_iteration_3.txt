The bug occurs because the logic equation for `q` is incorrectly implemented. The current assignment `q = a & 0` forces `q` to always be `0` regardless of `a`, since any value AND'ed with `0` results in `0`. This explains why Test Case 4 fails when `a=1` and `b=1` (the expected `q=1` is never achieved). The input `b` is not used in the equation, but the testbench clearly expects `q` to depend on **both** `a` and `b` (likely a logical AND operation between `a` and `b`). The root cause is a typo where `b` is replaced by a hardcoded `0` in the assignment.
