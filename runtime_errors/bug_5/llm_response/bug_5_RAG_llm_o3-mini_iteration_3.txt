The bug is caused by the way the comparisons are made. The code uses separate if statements that update min every time a smaller value is found. In Test Case 3, after initializing min to a (10), the code sees that c (8) is smaller and updates min to 8, but then it checks d (7) and, since 7 is even smaller than 8, it further updates min to 7. This behavior contradicts the requirement of stopping at the first value (from b, then c, then d) that is smaller than a.

Why is it occurring?
• The independent if statements make each comparison regardless of whether a previous condition has already been met.
• Once c becomes the first value smaller than a, the code should stop checking the next signals. However, because the if statements are not chained, d’s comparison is still performed.

How to fix it?
Replace the independent if statements with an if–else-if chain. This way, once a smaller value is found, the subsequent tests will not be evaluated. Here’s the corrected code:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] min
);

always @(*) begin
    if (b < a)
        min = b;
    else if (c < a)
        min = c;
    else if (d < a)
        min = d;
    else
        min = a;
end

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the fix:
• First the code checks if b is smaller than a. If true, min is assigned b and no further checks are performed.
• If b is not smaller than a, it then checks whether c is smaller than a. If it is, min is set to c.
• If both b and c are not smaller than a, then it checks if d is smaller.
• If none of b, c, or d are smaller than a, min is assigned a.
This change ensures that only the first encountered value (in the order of b, c, then d) that is smaller than a is used, which satisfies the requirement and passes the test case.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
