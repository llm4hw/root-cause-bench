The bug is that the code continuously overwrites min with any smaller value, rather than stopping at the very first value (in the order b, then c, then d) that is smaller than a. In your test case 3, although c is identified as the first candidate (c = 8 is smaller than a = 10), the subsequent check with d (d = 7, which is also smaller than 8) further updates min. The test bench expected min to remain 8 (the first occurrence of a smaller value), but it ends up as 7.

This error occurs because the always block uses separate if statements that are all evaluated, meaning that even after setting min to c, the later if statement for d can also update min. To meet the requirement, once a value is found to be smaller than a (in the order b, then c, then d), the subsequent conditions should not be evaluated.
