The problem is that the code finds the absolute minimum among a, b, c, and d instead of selecting the first value (in the order b, then c, then d) that is less than a.

In your code you start with:
  min = a;
  if (min > b) min = b;
  if (min > c) min = c;
  if (min > d) min = d;

When a = 10, b = 15, c = 8, and d = 7, what happens is:
 1. min is initialized to 10.
 2. b is compared; since 15 is not less than 10, min remains 10.
 3. c is compared; 8 is less than 10 so min becomes 8.
 4. d is compared; 7 is less than 8 so min becomes 7.

Thus, even though c was the first value encountered that was less than a, the check for d later overwrites min with 7.

The requirement, however, is to select the first value found in the order b, c, d that is less than a, and once that value is chosen, you should not override it later even if a later value is smaller.

To fix this bug, you should rewrite the logic to use an if-else chain so that once a candidate is selected, no further comparisons will change min. For example:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] min
);

always @(*) begin
    if (b < a)          // check b first
        min = b;
    else if (c < a)     // then check c
        min = c;
    else if (d < a)     // then check d
        min = d;
    else
        min = a;        // if none are smaller, use a
end

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

With this change, in Test Case 3 when a = 10, b = 15, c = 8, and d = 7:
 • b is not less than a,
 • c is less than a, so min is set to 8 and the else-if chain stops checking further,
thus meeting the requirement and producing the expected value.

In summary, the bug is occurring because independent if statements allow later values to override earlier ones. Changing to an if-else chain will ensure that only the first candidate (in the order b, then c, then d) that is less than a is assigned to min.
