The bug in the code is that the comparison in the test cases is incorrect. In Verilog, the comparison should be done using `==` instead of `!==`. 

In the testbench code, the comparisons like `if (min !== 10)` should be corrected to `if (min != 10)`. The same correction should be applied to all other test cases where comparisons are made.

To fix the issue, please update the test cases in the testbench code to use `==` for comparison, like `if (min == 10)`, `if (min == 5)`, `if (min == 8)`, and `if (min == 9)`.

After making this correction, please re-simulate the testbench to verify that the issue has been resolved.
