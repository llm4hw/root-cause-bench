The problem is that the code uses independent if statements that update min sequentially rather than selecting the very first signal (among b, c, d) that is smaller than a. In your test case 3, a = 10, b = 15, c = 8, and d = 7. The code does this:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Initializes min to a (10).  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Checks if a > b (10 > 15 false).  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Checks if min > c (10 > 8 true) and assigns min = c (8).  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Then checks if min > d (8 > 7 true) and then assigns min = d (7).

Because the if conditions are separate, the later if (if (min > d)) ‚Äúoverwrites‚Äù the earlier check that found c to be the first smaller than a.

The requirement is to ‚Äúassign the 1st value smaller than a‚Äù in order b, then c, then d. That means that once you have found a candidate (say, b or c), you should not check for subsequent signals.

The fix is to modify the code to use an if-else if-else structure so that once a smaller value is found, the remaining conditions are not evaluated. For example, the corrected code would be:

------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] min
);

always @(*) begin
    if (b < a)
        min = b;
    else if (c < a)
        min = c;
    else if (d < a)
        min = d;
    else
        min = a;
end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

How This Fix Works:

‚Ä¢ For test case 3 (a = 10, b = 15, c = 8, d = 7):  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì b is not less than a.  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì Then because c (8) is less than a (10), min is assigned to c.  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì The else if for d is not executed because an earlier condition was true.  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉThus, min remains 8.

This meets the requirement to capture the first occurrence of a value that is smaller than a, rather than taking the minimum among all values.
