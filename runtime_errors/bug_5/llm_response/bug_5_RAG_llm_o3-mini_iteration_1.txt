The bug is that the code always chooses the smallest value among a, b, c, and d rather than stopping at the first value that is smaller than a in the order b, then c, then d. In your test case 3 (a = 10, b = 15, c = 8, d = 7), the code works as follows:

• It starts with min = a = 10.  
• It checks if (min > b) → (10 > 15) is false, so min remains 10.  
• It checks if (min > c) → (10 > 8) is true, so min becomes 8.  
• It then checks if (min > d) → (8 > 7) is true, so min becomes 7.

Even though c (8) is the first value less than a, the code doesn’t stop there and later updates min to d, which is not what the requirement asks.

The problem occurs because each if statement is independent. As soon as one condition is met (c < a), min is updated, but later conditions (like d < min) can overwrite that value.

To fix the issue, you need to use an if-else chain so that once a condition is met, the remaining conditions are skipped. One possible fix is:

--------------------------------------------------
module top_module (
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    input [7:0] c,
    input [7:0] d,
    output reg [7:0] min
);

always @(*) begin
    // Check b first
    if (b < a)
        min = b;
    // Then check c only if b was not less than a
    else if (c < a)
        min = c;
    // Then check d only if neither b nor c was less than a
    else if (d < a)
        min = d;
    // Otherwise, set min to a
    else
        min = a;
end

endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

In this revised code, as soon as a candidate is found (e.g., b for test case 2 or c for test case 3), the rest of the conditions are not evaluated. This ensures that in test case 3 when c is the first value smaller than a, min is set to 8 and remains unchanged even though d (7) is smaller.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block

individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
