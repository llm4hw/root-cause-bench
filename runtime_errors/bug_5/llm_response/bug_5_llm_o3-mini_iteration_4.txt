The bug occurs because the logic keeps updating the output for every comparison rather than stopping when the first value smaller than a is found. In the test case (with a = 10, b = 15, c = 8, d = 7), the code first finds c (8) is smaller than a (10) and assigns min = 8. However, because the code then independently checks d without any mutual exclusion or early exit, it sees that 7 is smaller than 8 and updates min to 7. This behavior violates the requirement to assign the first encountered smaller value (which should be c, or 8) rather than the overall minimum.

The issue arises because the if statements are independent and sequential. That is, even after meeting the condition for c, the subsequent statement for d is still evaluated, and if d is even lower, it overwrites the correct value.

To fix the bug one would need to structure the comparisons so that after a smaller value is found (in the order b then c then d), no further comparisons alter min. This could typically be achieved by making the comparisons mutually exclusive (for example, using an if-else chain or additional flag) so that once a smaller value is assigned, the subsequent inputs are ignored.
