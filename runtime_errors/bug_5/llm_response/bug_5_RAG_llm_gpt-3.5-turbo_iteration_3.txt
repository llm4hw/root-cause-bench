The bug in the provided Verilog code is in the line `min = a;` within the `always @(*)` block. This line should be removed to satisfy the requirement of assigning the first value smaller than `a` to `min` in the order of `b-c-d`, else `min = a`.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified as follows:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (a <= b && a <= c && a <= d) begin
        min = a;
    end else if (b <= c && b <= d) begin
        min = b;
    end else if (c <= d) begin
        min = c;
    end else begin
        min = d;
    end
end
```

By making this change, the code will properly assign the first value smaller than `a` to `min` according to the order of `b-c-d` as required. This should resolve the error during simulation of the test bench.
