The error you're encountering in Test Case 3 is due to the logic implemented in your `always` block within the `top_module`. The goal is to assign to `min` the first value smaller than `a` in the order of `b`, `c`, `d`, otherwise keep `min` as `a`. The problem is that your current implementation is finding the smallest value among `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` instead of stopping at the first value smaller than `a`.

Let's analyze why Test Case 3 fails with the inputs `a = 10`, `b = 15`, `c = 8`, `d = 7`:
- According to the specified requirements, `min` should be `c` (8) because it's the first value smaller than `a` (`b` is not smaller, but `c` is).
- Your current logic evaluates all variables and results in `d` (7) being the smallest, which is not the intended behavior.

### Proposed Fix

You need to modify the logic in the `always` block to check each value in order and assign `min` at the first occurrence of a value smaller than `a`:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (b < a)
        min = b;
    else if (c < a)
        min = c;
    else if (d < a)
        min = d;
    else
        min = a;
end
```

### Explanation:
- Start by checking if `b` is smaller than `a`. If true, assign `b` to `min`.
- If not, check `c` next, and assign `c` to `min` if it's smaller than `a`.
- Then check `d`, and do the same.
- If none of `b`, `c`, or `d` are smaller than `a`, `min` should be `a`.

This approach ensures that `min` is assigned the value of the first variable that satisfies the condition, following the order requested (`b`, `c`, `d`).

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-

individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
