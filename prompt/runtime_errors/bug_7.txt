 user: Error message: ERROR: Expected Red (00), but got 11

Full code file:```module top_module (

	always @(posedge clk) begin
		if (~resetn) state <= Red;
		else state <= next;
	end
	always@(state) begin
		case (state)

			Ped: next = Red;
			Green: next = Yellow;
			Yellow: next = Red;

What is the bug, why is it occurring, and how can it be fixed?

    Note: this error occurred during the simulation of the test bench and code file below. It is an error message generated by the test bench itself. You should determine the root cause of the issue and explain the fix.
