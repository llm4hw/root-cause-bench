 user: Error message: ERROR: Test Case 3 failed. min = 7 (Expected: 8)

Full code file:```module top_module (
	input [7:0] a,
	input [7:0] b,
	input [7:0] c,
	input [7:0] d,
	output reg [7:0] min
);

always @(*) begin
		min = a;
		if (min > b) min = b;
		if (min > c) min = c;
		if (min > d) min = d;
	end

endmodule```

Testbench Code:```module tb_top_module;
    reg [7:0] a, b, c, d;
    wire [7:0] min;

    // Instantiate the module
    top_module uut (
        .a(a),
        .b(b),
        .c(c),
        .d(d),
        .min(min)
    );

    initial begin
        $display("Testbench started.");

        // Test Case 1: All greater than a -> min should be a
        a = 8'd10; b = 8'd20; c = 8'd30; d = 8'd40;
        #10;
        if (min !== 10) begin
            $display("ERROR: Test Case 1 failed. min = %d (Expected: 10)", min);
            $fatal;
        end

        // Test Case 2: b is the first smaller -> min should be b
        a = 8'd10; b = 8'd5; c = 8'd6; d = 8'd7;
        #10;
        if (min !== 5) begin
            $display("ERROR: Test Case 2 failed. min = %d (Expected: 5)", min);
            $fatal;
        end

        // Test Case 3: b is greater, c is smaller -> min should be c
        a = 8'd10; b = 8'd15; c = 8'd8; d = 8'd7;
        #10;
        if (min !== 8) begin
            $display("ERROR: Test Case 3 failed. min = %d (Expected: 8)", min);
            $fatal;
        end

        // Test Case 4: b, c are greater, d is smaller -> min should be d
        a = 8'd10; b = 8'd15; c = 8'd18; d = 8'd9;
        #10;
        if (min !== 9) begin
            $display("ERROR: Test Case 4 failed. min = %d (Expected: 9)", min);
            $fatal;
        end

        $display("All test cases passed.");
        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```


Scenario:
above is the Verilog code for conditional check, however, it cannot satisfy the requirement: assign the 1st value smaller than `a` to `min` in the order of b-c-d, else `min = a`.

What is the bug, why is it occurring, and how can it be fixed?

    Note: this error occurred during the simulation of the test bench and code file below. It is an error message generated by the test bench itself. You should determine the root cause of the issue and explain the fix.
