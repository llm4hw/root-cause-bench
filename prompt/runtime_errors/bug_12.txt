 user: Error message: ERROR: Expected result = 1 when a = b

Full code file:```module faulty_comparator (
    input [3:0] a, // 4-bit input
    input [3:0] b, // 4-bit input
    output reg result // Result of comparison
);
    always @(*) begin
        if (a == 5'b10101) begin
            result = 1;
        end else begin
            result = 0;
        end
    end
endmodule```

Testbench Code:```module tb_fixed_comparator;
    reg [3:0] a, b;
    wire result;

    // Instantiate the module
    faulty_comparator uut (
        .a(a),
        .b(b),
        .result(result)
    );

    initial begin
        $display("Testbench started.");

        // Test case 1: a == b
        a = 4'd9; b = 4'd9;
        #10;
        if (result !== 1) $fatal("ERROR: Expected result = 1 when a = b");

        // Test case 2: a != b
        a = 4'd7; b = 4'd2;
        #10;
        if (result !== 0) $fatal("ERROR: Expected result = 0 when a != b");

What is the bug, why is it occurring, and how can it be fixed?

    Note: this error occurred during the simulation of the test bench and code file below. It is an error message generated by the test bench itself. You should determine the root cause of the issue and explain the fix.
