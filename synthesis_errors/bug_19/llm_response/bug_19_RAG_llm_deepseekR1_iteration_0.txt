### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because **`2'b2` is an invalid binary literal** in Verilog. In binary representation:
- Digits after `'b` must only be `0` or `1` (e.g., `2'b00`, `2'b01`).
- The digit `2` is illegal in binary notation, causing a syntax error during synthesis.

### Why This Happened
In the code:
```verilog
else begin
    y = 2'b2;  // Illegal: '2' is not a valid binary digit
end
```
`2'b2` attempts to represent a 2-bit binary value but uses an invalid digit (`2`). This violates Verilog syntax rules for binary literals.

### Fix
Replace `2'b2` with a valid 2-bit binary value. Based on the context:
- If the intent is to output decimal `2` (binary `10`), use **`2'b10`**.
- If the intent is to output all ones, use `2'b11`.

**Corrected Code:**
```verilog
else begin
    y = 2'b10; // Fixed: Valid binary (decimal value 2)
end
```

### Explanation of Fix
- **`2'b10`** is the binary representation of decimal `2` (1√ó2¬π + 0√ó2‚Å∞ = 2).
- This matches the pattern in the code (`2'b00` for `0`, `2'b01` for `1`).

### Full Corrected Module
```verilog
module top19(
    input [1:0] a,
    output reg [1:0] y
);

always @*
begin
    if (a == 2'b00) begin
        y = 2'b00;
    end else if (a == 2'b01) begin
        y = 2'b01;
    end else begin
        y = 2'b10; // Fixed line
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Key Takeaways
1. **Binary Literal Rules** in Verilog:
   - Format: `<size>'b<binary_digits>`
   - Valid digits: `0` and `1` only.
2. **Common Alternatives**:
   - `2'd2` (decimal notation),
   - `2'h2` (hexadecimal, equivalent to `2'b10`).
3. Always use valid digits for the specified base to avoid synthesis errors.
