### Issue Analysis
The error occurs due to an **invalid binary literal** in the assignment `y = 2'b2;`. Here's why:

1. **Illegal Character in Binary Literal**:  
   In Verilog, binary literals must only contain digits `0` or `1` after the `'b` prefix. The character `2` in `2'b2` is invalid because `2` is not a valid binary digit. Binary digits represent logical states (0 = LOW, 1 = HIGH), and no other digits are permitted.

2. **Context of the Error**:  
   The code attempts to assign a value to `y` in the `else` branch when `a` is neither `2'b00` nor `2'b01`. The invalid literal `2'b2` violates Verilog syntax rules, causing the synthesis tool to fail.

3. **Synthesis Tool Limitation**:  
   The error `[Synth 8-2108]` explicitly flags this as a syntax error during synthesis. Synthesis tools require strict adherence to HDL syntax and cannot interpret non-binary digits in binary literals.

### Root Cause
- **Invalid Digit**: The digit `2` in `2'b2` is not a valid binary digit.  
- **Literal Format**: Binary literals in Verilog must follow the format `<size>'b<binary_digits>`, where `<binary_digits>` can only be `0` or `1`.  
- **Consequence**: The tool rejects the design because it cannot parse `2` as part of a binary number.

### How to Fix
1. **Replace the Invalid Literal**:  
   Change `2'b2` to a valid 2-bit binary value (e.g., `2'b10`, `2'b11`, or another value matching the intended behavior). For example:  
   ```verilog
   y = 2'b10; // Assigns binary '10' (decimal 2)
   ```

2. **Verify Design Intent**:  
   Determine what value `y` should take in the `else` branch:
   - If the goal is to output a decimal `2`, use `2'b10` (since `10` binary = `2` decimal).  
   - If the goal is to set both bits to `1`, use `2'b11`.  
   - Avoid non-binary digits entirely.

3. **Prevent Future Errors**:  
   Always use valid binary digits (`0`, `1`) in binary literals. For other bases (e.g., hexadecimal), use `'h` instead of `'b`.

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier
- **Simulation vs. Synthesis**: Simulators might overlook this error if the code is never executed in testbenches, but synthesis tools rigorously check all branches.  
- **Incomplete Testing**: Testbenches might not cover the `else` branch where `a` is `2'b10` or `2'b11`, allowing the bug to evade simulation.  
- **Syntax vs. Logic**: This is a syntax error (caught during synthesis), not a logical error (which might only surface during simulation).

Fix the literal to resolve the error.
