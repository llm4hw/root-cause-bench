### Bug Analysis
The error occurs due to an **invalid binary literal** in the line:
```verilog
y = 2'b2; 
```

### Why this occurs:
1. **Illegal Character**: In Verilog, binary literals must use only `0` or `1` digits after `'b` (base specifier). The digit `2` is invalid in binary representation.
2. **Syntax Violation**: `2'b2` attempts to define a 2-bit binary number but uses `2` (a non-binary digit), which violates Verilog syntax rules.

### Fix
Replace the invalid literal with a valid 2-bit binary value. Based on the context of the code (which handles inputs `2'b00` and `2'b01`), the likely intended value is `2'b10`:

```verilog
y = 2'b10; // Corrected binary literal
```

### Fixed Code:
```verilog
module top19(
    input [1:0] a,
    output reg [1:0] y
);

always @*
begin
    if (a == 2'b00) begin
        y = 2'b00;
    end else if (a == 2'b01) begin
        y = 2'b01;
    end else begin
        y = 2'b10; // Fixed: Valid 2-bit binary
    end
end
endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Binary Literal Rules**: Verilog requires binary numbers to follow the format `[size]'b[0/1_value]` (e.g., `2'b10` for decimal 2).
- **Simulation/Synthesis Impact**: Tools like Vivado/Synopsys will reject invalid digits during compilation, halting simulation/synthesis.

This fix resolves the syntax error while maintaining the original logic for the `else` case.
