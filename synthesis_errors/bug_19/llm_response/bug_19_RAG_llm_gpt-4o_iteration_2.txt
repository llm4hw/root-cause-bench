The error message you're encountering is due to an illegal binary number specification in the line `y = 2'b2;`. In Verilog, binary numbers are specified using 'b' followed by a sequence of binary digits (0 or 1). The number `2'b2` is illegal because binary numbers can only consist of the digits 0 and 1; the digit '2' is invalid in this context.

To fix this issue, you'll need to assign a valid binary number to `y`. If your intention is to set `y` to a default or error state, you might consider using a valid binary value like `2'b10` or `2'b11`, depending on the desired behavior for this else condition. Here‚Äôs a possible modification:

```verilog
else begin
    y = 2'b10; // or another valid binary value, depending on the intended logic
end
```

Choose the appropriate valid binary value that fits the logic you intend to implement for `y` when `a` is neither `2'b00` nor `2'b01`.
