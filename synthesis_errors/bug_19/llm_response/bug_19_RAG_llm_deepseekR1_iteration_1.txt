### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because of an **illegal binary literal** in the code:
```verilog
y = 2'b2;  // Error: '2' is invalid in binary representation
```

### Why This Occurs
1. **Invalid Character in Binary Literal**: 
   - Binary literals in Verilog must only use `0`, `1`, `x` (unknown), or `z` (high-impedance) digits.
   - The digit `2` (used in `2'b2`) is **not a valid binary digit**, causing the synthesis tool to throw an error.

2. **Literal Format Issue**:
   - The literal `2'b2` attempts to represent a 2-bit binary value but:
     - Uses only one digit (`2`) instead of two digits (required for 2-bit width)
     - Contains an illegal character (`2`)

### Fix
Replace the invalid literal with a **valid 2-bit binary value**. Based on context, the likely intended values are:

```verilog
// Option 1: Assign 2'b10 (binary 2)
y = 2'b10; 

// Option 2: Assign 2'b11 (binary 3)
y = 2'b11;
```

**Corrected Code:**
```verilog
module top19(
    input [1:0] a,
    output reg [1:0] y
);

always @*
begin
    if (a == 2'b00) begin
        y = 2'b00;
    end else if (a == 2'b01) begin
        y = 2'b01;
    end else begin
        y = 2'b10; // Fixed: Valid binary literal
    end
end
endmodule
```

### Why This Fix Works
- **Valid Digits**: `2'b10` uses only valid binary digits (`1` and `0`)
- **Correct Width**: Specifies two digits for a 2-bit signal, matching the declaration `output reg [1:0] y`
- **Synthesis Compliance**: Tools like Vivado/Xilinx synthesizers strictly enforce binary literal rules.

### Additional Notes
- **Literal Rules in Verilog**:
  - Binary: `<size>'b<binary_digits>` (e.g., `2'b10`, `4'b1100`)
  - Digits must be `0`, `1`, `x`, or `z` only.
- **Common Alternatives**:
  - Use decimal literals: `y = 2'd2;` (equivalent to `2'b10`)
  - Use hexadecimal: `y = 2'h2;` (also equivalent to `2'b10`)

The fix resolves the syntax error while maintaining the intended logic for the `else` case.
