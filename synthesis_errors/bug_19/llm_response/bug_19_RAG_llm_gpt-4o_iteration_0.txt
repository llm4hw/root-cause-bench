The error message "illegal character in binary number" is caused by the line `y = 2'b2;`. In Verilog, binary numbers are denoted using `b` and can only contain the digits `0` and `1`. Thus, `2'b2` is incorrect because `2` is not a valid binary digit.

The root cause of the issue is attempting to assign a binary number using a digit outside of the binary range (i.e., `0` and `1`). This mistake likely stems from either an incorrect understanding of binary notation or an attempt to handle a condition where `a` does not match the other specified cases.

To fix this error, ensure that `y` is assigned a valid binary value consisting of only `0`s and `1`s. If the intention was to handle an undefined case when `a` is neither `2'b00` nor `2'b01`, consider using a default value.

One possible fix could be:

```verilog
always @*
begin
    if (a == 2'b00) begin
        y = 2'b00;
    end else if (a == 2'b01) begin
        y = 2'b01;
    end else begin
        y = 2'b10; // or some other valid binary assignment
    end
end
```

This assigns `y` to a valid binary number. Alternatively, if you intended to indicate an error or an unused state, choosing a value like `2'b11` or another logic-based signal might be more appropriate depending on the specific requirements of your design.
