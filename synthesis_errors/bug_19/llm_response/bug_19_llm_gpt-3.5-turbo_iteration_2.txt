The bug in the code is that an illegal character '2' is being used within a binary number declaration '2'b2'. In Verilog, binary numbers are represented as '0' and '1', so using '2' in the binary number declaration is incorrect and resulting in the error.

To fix this issue, the binary number declaration should only contain '0' or '1' in each digit. Use '2'b10' instead of '2'b2' to represent binary '10'. 

Once you correct the binary number declaration within the assignment, the error should be resolved, and the code should simulate successfully.
