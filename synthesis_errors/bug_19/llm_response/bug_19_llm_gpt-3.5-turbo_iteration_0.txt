The bug in the code is on line 34, where an illegal binary number '2' is assigned to the two-bit signal 'y' using 2'b2. The correct binary representation should only include '0' and '1', as per the binary system.

The error message appears during simulation because the format of 2'b2 is not a valid binary representation and hence is not recognized by the tool.

To fix this bug, you need to correct the illegal binary representation `2'b2` on line 34 and replace it with a valid two-bit binary value that consists only of '0' and '1'.
