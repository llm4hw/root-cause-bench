The error message indicates that there is an issue with the assignment `y = 2'b2;` in your Verilog code. The problem here is that the binary number `2'b2` is invalid because binary literals only consist of the digits 0 and 1. In a binary representation, each digit must be 0 or 1, so a value of 2 in a binary literal is nonsensical.

Verilog uses a prefix to indicate the base of the numerical literal, with `b` indicating binary. A two-digit binary number can only contain combinations of the digits 0 and 1, i.e., 2'b00, 2'b01, 2'b10, or 2'b11. The number 2 is not a valid digit in binary, which is why you see the "illegal character" error.

To fix this issue, you need to change the assignment so that `y` is assigned a valid binary value. You should decide on an appropriate value from the valid binary combinations according to the desired logic of your code. For example, if `y` is intended to be set to a "default" invalid state or a maximum state when `a` is not 2'b00 or 2'b01, you might choose `2'b11`, which is the largest two-bit binary number. However, you'll have to decide the correct value based on your intended functionality.
