The error message you're encountering ("illegal character in binary number") is due to the assignment `y = 2'b2;` in your Verilog code. In Verilog, binary numbers must be specified with only '0' and '1'. The syntax `2'b2` is incorrect because '2' is not a valid binary digit.

To fix this error, you should assign a 2-bit binary number consisting of '0' and '1'. If you meant to signal an error or invalid state when `a` is neither `2'b00` nor `2'b01`, you need to use valid binary representation. Here are a few potential solutions, depending on your intent:

1. If you want to indicate that this is an invalid state, you could assign a default or error value that is within binary range:
   ```verilog
   y = 2'b11; // or any valid 2-bit binary number indicating an error or default.
   ```

2. If you want to leave `y` unchanged in this condition, you could add a condition to not change its value:
   ```verilog
   // No else statement or do nothing in else, if y should remain unchanged
   ```

3. If your design expectation is that no other states should occur, adjust your testbench to ensure `a` only takes on valid values or handle the unexpected state with some logging or a specific in-debug assignment.

Ensure your code and test cases align in expected behavior and your number representations use valid binary digits.
