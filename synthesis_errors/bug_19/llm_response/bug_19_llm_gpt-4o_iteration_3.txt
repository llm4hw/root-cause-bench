The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-2108] illegal character in binary number" indicates a syntax problem in the Verilog code, specifically with how a binary literal is being represented.

In Verilog, binary literals are specified using the format `b'binary_digits`, where `b` indicates the base (binary, in this case), and `binary_digits` represents the actual binary number. The issue arises because the literal `2'b2` is invalid; `2'b2` is interpreted as a binary number with 2 bits, but '2' is not a valid binary digit (binary digits can only be 0 or 1).

The problem is occurring because you have specified a binary number `2'b2` with an invalid digit. This type of mistake causes the synthesis tool to flag an error because it cannot interpret '2' as a binary digit. In binary representation, only the digits '0' and '1' are allowed. Since '2' doesn't represent either of these, it causes an error.

To resolve this issue, the binary value must be valid. You likely intended to use a binary value that fits within a 2-bit range, which includes `2'b00`, `2'b01`, `2'b10`, and `2'b11`. This part of the code seems to indicate default behavior for the output `y`, assuming it's for any value of `a` not explicitly checked earlier. To fix this error, determine which valid 2-bit binary number represents the desired state or handling for this default case. If you're looking for `a = 2'b10` or `2'b11`, you'll need to rewrite the logic accordingly to use valid binary values.
