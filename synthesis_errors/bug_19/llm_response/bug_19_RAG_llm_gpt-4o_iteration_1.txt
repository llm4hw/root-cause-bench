The bug in the code is the assignment `y = 2'b2;` within the `else` block. In Verilog, binary numbers are represented with a prefix `b` and each digit must be a binary digit (0 or 1). The literal `2'b2` attempts to use '2' as a binary digit, which is not allowed, leading to the "illegal character in binary number" error message.

To fix this error, you need to provide a valid binary number for the assignment. Since `y` is a 2-bit vector, each bit can be either '0' or '1'. For example, if you need y to take a value that reflects an invalid state when `a` is not `2'b00` or `2'b01`, you might want to assign another valid binary number such as `2'b10` or `2'b11`.

A possible fix for the code:
```verilog
always @*
begin
    if (a == 2'b00) begin
        y = 2'b00;
    end else if (a == 2'b01) begin
        y = 2'b01;
    end else begin
        y = 2'b10; // or use 2'b11
    end
end
```

Here, `2'b10` or `2'b11` represents valid binary numbers and will correct the error by ensuring that each bit is either 0 or 1.
