The problem comes from the literal "2'b2". In Verilog, when using a binary number literal (specified by a width, an apostrophe, a base indicator, and then the number), only the digits 0 and 1 are allowed. Using the digit '2' in a binary number is illegal. This error message is generated because the synthesizer (or simulation tool) encounters an illegal character when parsing the literal.

The root cause is that the literal is meant to represent an intended value for a 2-bit signal, but the syntax is incorrect. In binary, if you intend to represent the decimal number 2, you should use a combination of only binary digits (0 and 1).

To fix this issue, you would need to change the literal so that it uses proper binary digits that correspond to the intended value.
