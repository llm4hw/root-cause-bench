The error in the code occurs at line 34, where a binary number `2'b2` is assigned to the `y` variable, which is invalid in Verilog. In Verilog, you can only have binary values that consist of 0s and 1s, and the binary base should be followed by valid binary digits.

The correct binary representation for the value 2 in a 2-bit binary number is `2'b10`. The issue is occurring because `2'b2` is not a valid binary number representation.

To fix this issue, you should replace `2'b2` with the correct binary representation `2'b10`. This would resolve the error in the code.
