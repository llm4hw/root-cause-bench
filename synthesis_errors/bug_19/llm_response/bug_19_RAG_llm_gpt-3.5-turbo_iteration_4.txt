The bug in the code is at the line `y = 2'b2;`. The error message "illegal character in binary number" is occurring because Verilog binary numbers should only contain 0s and 1s, not other characters like '2' in this case.

To fix this issue, you should correct the binary number to match the standard binary format by replacing `2'b2` with a valid binary value (e.g., `2'b10` for binary 2).

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```verilog
else begin
    y = 2'b10; 
end
```

By making this correction, the error related to the illegal character in the binary number should be resolved.
