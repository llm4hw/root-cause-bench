The error message you're encountering, "illegal character in binary number," arises from the assignment `y = 2'b2;` in your code. In Verilog, binary numbers are specified with a size and a value using the format `size'bvalue`. Here, the value should be represented using binary digits '0' or '1'. However, '2' is not a valid binary digit, which is causing the error.

To fix this bug, you should replace `2'b2` with a valid 2-bit binary number. Since a 2-bit number can only range from `2'b00` (0 in decimal) to `2'b11` (3 in decimal), you might want to replace it with one of these valid values depending on your design's intended logic.

For example:
- If you intend to assign a value of `2` to `y`, then you should write `y = 2'b10;` because `2'b10` represents the binary equivalent of decimal `2`.

Here's the corrected code snippet:

```verilog
else begin
    y = 2'b10;  // Assuming you want to set 'y' to decimal 2
end
```

Ensure that any binary number you use is constructed with appropriate binary digits ('0' and '1') for correctness according to Verilog language rules.
