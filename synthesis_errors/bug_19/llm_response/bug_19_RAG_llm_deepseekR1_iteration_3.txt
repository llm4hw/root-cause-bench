### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because `2'b2` contains an illegal character (`2`) in a binary literal. In Verilog, binary literals must only contain digits `0`, `1`, `x`, or `z`. The digit `2` is invalid in binary representation.

### Why This Occurs
1. **Syntax Violation**: 
   - Binary literals in Verilog follow the format `<size>'b<binary_digits>`.
   - Valid binary digits are `0`, `1`, `x` (unknown), and `z` (high-impedance).
   - `2'b2` attempts to use `2` as a binary digit, which is invalid.

2. **Incorrect Fallback Value**: 
   - The `else` branch assigns `y = 2'b2;` when `a` is neither `2'b00` nor `2'b01`.
   - This likely intends to handle cases like `a = 2'b10` or `2'b11`, but uses an illegal value.

### Fix
Replace `2'b2` with a valid 2-bit binary literal. Since the `else` branch covers `a` values `2'b10` and `2'b11`, assign one of these as the default. For example:

```verilog
else begin
    y = 2'b10; // Valid 2-bit binary (value 2 in decimal)
end
```

### Corrected Code
```verilog
module top19(
    input [1:0] a,
    output reg [1:0] y
);

always @*
begin
    if (a == 2'b00) begin
        y = 2'b00;
    end else if (a == 2'b01) begin
        y = 2'b01;
    end else begin
        y = 2'b10; // Fixed: Valid binary literal
    end
end

endmodule
```

### Key Points
- **Binary Literal Rules**: Use only `0`, `1`, `x`, or `z` between `'b` and the value.
- **Design Clarity**: The fix uses `2'b10` as a safe default, but choose a value that aligns with your design requirements (e.g., `2'b11` if needed).
- **Prevention**: Always verify literals for valid characters. Tools like linters can catch these errors early.
