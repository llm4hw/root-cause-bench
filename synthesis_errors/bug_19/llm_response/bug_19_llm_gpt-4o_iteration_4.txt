The error message you are encountering is due to an incorrect assignment in binary notation within your Verilog code. Specifically, the line `y = 2'b2;` is invalid because the binary notation `2'b` expects binary digits (0 or 1), and '2' is not a valid binary digit.

In Verilog, when you represent values using binary notation, you prefix the number with the base (in this case, '2' means binary and the 'b' signifies the following digits are binary). So, `2'b2` is incorrect because the only allowable digits for a binary number are '0' and '1'.

The expression is attempting to assign a binary representation of the decimal number '2' directly using an invalid digit, which causes the synthesizer to throw an error on encountering the illegal character.

To resolve this issue, you need to represent the numbers with valid binary digits. When you're assigning values for 2-bit wide data, keep in mind: 
- The binary representation for the decimal number 2 using 2 bits is `2'b10`.

Therefore, you should replace `y = 2'b2;` with `y = 2'b10;`, which is the correct 2-bit binary representation of the decimal number 2. This will ensure that there are no illegal characters used in your binary number assignments.
