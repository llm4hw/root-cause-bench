The error occurs because Verilog binary literals can only contain digits `0` or `1`. The value `2'b2` in line 34 uses an invalid digit `2`, which is not allowed in binary representation.

**Bug Breakdown:**
1. **Invalid Character:** `2'b2` contains the digit `2`, which is illegal in binary numbers (only 0/1 are valid)
2. **Literal Syntax:** Verilog requires binary values after `'b` to strictly use 0/1 (e.g., `2'b10` is valid, `2'b2` is not)
3. **Tool Detection:** The synthesis tool ([Synth 8-2108]) flags this during compilation because it violates Verilog syntax rules

**Fix:**
Replace the invalid literal with a valid 2-bit binary value. Based on common patterns:
```verilog
y = 2'b10;  // Most likely intended (binary '10' = decimal 2)
```
**Fixed Code Section:**
```verilog
else begin
    y = 2'b10;  // Corrected binary literal
end
```

**Explanation:**
- `2'b10` represents the binary number `10` (equivalent to decimal value 2)
- This matches the apparent intent of writing "2" while following Verilog syntax rules
- The fixed code will now compile without syntax errors

**Additional Notes:**
1. If you intended different values for the `a=2'b10` and `a=2'b11` cases (both currently falling into the `else` branch), add explicit cases:
```verilog
else if (a == 2'b10) y = 2'b10;
else if (a == 2'b11) y = 2'b11; 
```
2. Always verify binary literals contain only 0/1 digits after the `'b` prefix
