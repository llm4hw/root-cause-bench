The error message you are encountering, "ERROR: [Synth 8-2108] illegal character in binary number," stems from an incorrect assignment in the Verilog code. The key issue is related to the statement `y = 2'b2;` in the `else` condition.

In Verilog, the literal `2'b2` is intended to represent a 2-bit binary number, and it follows the format `N'bV`, where `N` is the number of bits and `V` is the binary value. However, binary numbers can only consist of the digits 0 and 1. The digit '2' is not a valid binary digit, which causes the syntax error. In binary form, the valid values for 2 bits are `00`, `01`, `10`, or `11`, which correspond to decimal values 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

In this context, writing `y = 2'b2;` is incorrect because it implies that you're trying to use the digit '2' in a binary number, which is not allowed. That's why the Verilog compiler is throwing an illegal character error.

To resolve this bug, ensure that the binary number represented uses only the digits '0' and '1'. If you intended to assign the binary equivalent of the decimal value '2' to `y`, it should be written in binary format as `2'b10`. This would ensure that you have a valid binary value assigned which aligns with your intentions if you wanted `y` to hold the decimal value 2.
