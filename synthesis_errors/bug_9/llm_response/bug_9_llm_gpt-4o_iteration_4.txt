The error you are encountering is due to the inappropriate use of the `b` signal, which is declared as an `out` signal in your VHDL entity. Here's what's happening:

1. **`out` Mode Limitation**: In VHDL, a signal that is declared with the `out` mode in an entity's port list can only be driven by the architecture's internal logic. You are not allowed to read from an `out` signal. This is because `out` is meant for driving values out of a module, rather than in both directions or for feedback into the module.

2. **Error Line**: The offending line `temp_signal <= a and b;` attempts to read from `b`, which is declared as an `out` signal. Reading from an `out` signal directly is forbidden, hence the error.

The core issue is that VHDL expects different signal modes for signals used for both input and output. If you need to read from `b` within the architecture, you have two viable choices:

- **Use `buffer` Mode**: You can declare `b` as a `buffer` instead of `out`. The `buffer` mode allows the signal to be both read and written within the architecture. However, using `buffer` has its own restrictions and is generally discouraged in favor of more modern practices.

- **Use `inout` Mode**: Another option is to declare `b` as `inout`. This mode allows the signal to be read and written by both the architecture and an external source. However, `inout` ports are typically used for bidirectional data lines rather than situations like this.

However, both of these fixes require careful consideration of the design implications and whether modifying the port mode aligns with the intended functionality of your design.
