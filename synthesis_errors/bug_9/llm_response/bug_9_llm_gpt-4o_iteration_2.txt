The error message indicates that the VHDL code contains an attempt to read from an 'out' port, specifically the port 'b'. In VHDL, 'out' ports are designed for output only, meaning they can only be driven by internal signals within the architecture and cannot be read back. As a result, using them as operands in expressions or assignments, as in the line `temp_signal <= a and b;`, is not allowed, which is why you're encountering an error.

In your specific code, the line `temp_signal <= a and b;` is attempting to perform a logical AND operation using 'a' and 'b', but 'b' is declared as an 'out' port and cannot be read. 

To fix this issue, you would need to either:

1. Change the port mode of 'b' to 'inout' if 'b' needs to be both read from and written to by the entity. However, this should only be done if the design truly needs 'b' to be updated based on some internal signal and also be used in expressions.

2. Alternatively, if 'b' is only supposed to be an output and not be read within the entity, reconsider the logic that requires reading 'b' and refactor it so that 'temp_signal' does not depend on reading 'b'. This might involve rethinking the design or what 'b' represents in the context of your system.

The choice between these options will depend on the broader context of your design and the intended functionality of the ports.
