The error message you are encountering indicates an issue with the directionality specified for the object `b` in the VHDL code. Specifically, the problem arises from the fact that you are attempting to read from the object `b`, which is defined as an `out` port in the entity declaration.

In VHDL, `out` ports are intended to be written to by the architecture in which they are declared, but they are not meant to be read from within that architecture. Thus, when you are using `b` in the expression `temp_signal <= a and b;`, you are attempting to read from an `out` port, which is not allowed. This is the root cause of the error.

To resolve this issue, you could change the mode of `b` to allow reading from it. This can be done by changing the direction of `b` from `out` to either `inout` or `buffer`. Using `inout` allows the signal to be both read and written, while `buffer` also allows for reading and writing but is somewhat less common in modern designs due to its specific use cases and restrictions.

Please note that changing the port mode will have implications on how interaction with `b` is handled in other components or when the `top9` entity is instantiated elsewhere. Ensure that the intended functionality aligns with these changes in directionality.
