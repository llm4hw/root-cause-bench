The error occurs because the design is attempting to read (or use) the value of the port "b" even though it’s declared as an output. In VHDL, an output port is meant only for sending data out of the entity (not for reading within the architecture), unless it’s declared as a "buffer" or "inout" type.

In your code, the concurrent assignment

  temp_signal <= a and b;

tries to evaluate "a and b". Since "b" is an output port (declared with “out std_logic”), the simulator complains that it cannot read from "b".

To fix the issue you have two options:
1. If you intended to use "b" as an internal signal that drives output but is also used inside the architecture, change its port mode from "out" to "buffer". For example:

  b : buffer std_logic;

2. Alternatively, if "b" is meant to be driven externally (i.e., only an output) and should not be read internally, then change the code so that you do not read from "b". Perhaps you meant to use another internal signal in the assignment.

The bug is therefore due to a mismatch between how the port is declared (output-only) and how the code attempts to use it (reading its value). Choosing the correct port mode or modifying the logic resolves the error.

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
