The error occurs because the design tries to read the value from port b even though b is declared as an output port. In VHDL, an output port is intended for driving a signal out of the entity, not for being read (unless it is declared as BUFFER or INOUT). Here, the expression

  temp_signal <= a and b;

attempts to use the value of b in a logical AND operation. Since b is declared as an out signal, the simulator rejects the read, throwing the error:

  "cannot read from 'out' object b; use 'buffer' or 'inout'".

To fix the issue, you have two main options:

1. Change the port mode of b from OUT to BUFFER (if synthesis and simulation allow buffers in your flow), so that the port can be read within the architecture.

  For example:
    b : buffer std_logic;

2. Alternatively, if the intention is not to actually read the value of b (or if the design logic is mistaken), you should modify the code so that you use the correct signals. For example, if the operation should use a different input or an internal signal instead of b, adjust the expression accordingly. You might create an internal signal, assign it with the correct source, and then drive port b from that internal signal.

Choose the option that fits your design intent. The error is raised because the VHDL standard does not allow reading an out port unless declared differently, and changing the declaration or design will resolve the simulation error.

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
