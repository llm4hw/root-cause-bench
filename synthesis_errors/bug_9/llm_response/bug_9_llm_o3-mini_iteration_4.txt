The problem here is that the entity's port b is declared as an output. In VHDL, ports declared with the mode "out" are intended to only be assigned values, not read from. However, the code is trying to use b as a signal in the expression "a and b" (i.e., reading its value), which is not allowed for an output port.

This error occurs because the synthesis tool is enforcing the VHDL language rules that an "out" port cannot be read. To resolve the issue, the port b would need to be declared such that its value can be read (for example, by declaring it as a "buffer" or "inout" port) or by redesigning the architecture so that b is not used as an input in the logic expression.
