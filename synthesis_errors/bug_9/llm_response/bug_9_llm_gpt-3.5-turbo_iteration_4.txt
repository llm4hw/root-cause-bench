The error message indicates that there is an issue in the line where you are assigning the value of 'a and b' to the signal 'temp_signal'. The error specifically mentions that you cannot read from an 'out' object 'b'. 

In VHDL, an 'out' port is used for outputs from an entity, and it cannot be read directly like an 'in' port. In this case, you are trying to use 'b', which is an 'out' port, in the expression 'a and b'.

To fix this issue, you need to either change the port 'b' in the entity declaration to 'buffer' or 'inout' type, or you need to rethink the logic of your design to not rely on directly reading from an 'out' port.

You may need to reconsider the design of your code to ensure that the interaction between 'a' and 'b' is correctly implemented without relying on reading from an 'out' port directly for a finalized solution.
