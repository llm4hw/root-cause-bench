The error occurs because VHDL does not allow you to read the value of a port declared as an output (‚Äúout‚Äù). In your code you attempt to use b in the expression "a and b", but since b is an out port (i.e., only meant to be driven by the entity), its value cannot be read inside the architecture.

There are two common ways to fix this issue:

1. If you intend to both drive and read the value of b internally, you can change the port mode from out to buffer. For example:

   ‚Ä¢ Modify the entity declaration for b as follows:
     
     a : in std_logic;
     b : buffer std_logic;

   This lets you both drive and read b, although note that the use of 'buffer' is less common and has some limitations in more complex designs.

2. Alternatively, you can declare an internal signal that gets assigned to and from b. For example, you can declare an internal signal (say, b_sig) and then assign its value to b in a separate concurrent assignment. This maintains b as an output (for synthesis clarity) but allows you to use b_sig internally. A modified version of your code would look like this:

   library ieee;
   use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
   use ieee.numeric_std.all;

   entity top9 is
       port (
           a : in std_logic;
           b : out std_logic
       );
   end entity top9;

   architecture rtl of top9 is
       signal b_sig : std_logic;
       signal temp_signal : std_logic;
   begin
       -- Use the internal signal in your logic
       temp_signal <= a and b_sig;

       -- Drive the output port from the internal signal
       b <= b_sig;
   end architecture rtl;

Choose the solution that best fits your design requirement. The error is being flagged by the test bench because it is simulating the code and the simulator enforces that you should not read out ports (unless using buffer or inout).
