### Root Cause Analysis
The core issue occurs because you're attempting to **read from an output port** (`b`) in the expression `a and b`. In VHDL:
- Ports declared as `out` are **write-only** within their own entity
- Reading an `out` port violates VHDL's mode restrictions (it's undefined behavior)

### Why This Error Occurs
1. **Port Mode Violation**:  
   The line `temp_signal <= a and b;` tries to read the value of `b`, but `b` is strictly an output port. VHDL forbids reading outputs because:
   - Output ports represent signals driven *externally* from the entity
   - There's no defined value for an `out` port *inside* the entity

2. **Tool Enforcement**:  
   The synthesis tool (Xilinx Vivado) detects this illegal read operation and throws error `[Synth 8-1779]`, explicitly stating the port mode conflict.

### Correct Fix Approach
To resolve this, you must **reconfigure how the output port is accessed**:
1. **Preferred Solution**:  
   Create an **internal copy** of the output signal:
   - Declare an internal signal (e.g., `b_internal`)
   - Drive the actual output port `b` from this internal signal
   - Use `b_internal` in your logic instead of directly reading `b`

2. **Alternative (Less Recommended)**:  
   Change the port mode of `b` to:
   - `buffer` (allows reading the driven output value)
   - `inout` (bidirectional, allows reading but overcomplicates simple outputs)

### Critical Note
Your current code has a **secondary issue**:  
The output port `b` is never assigned any value. Even after fixing the read error, you'll need to drive `b` (or its internal equivalent) somewhere in the architecture to avoid undefined output.
