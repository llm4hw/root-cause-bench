### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because you're attempting to **read the value of an output port (`b`) inside your VHDL entity**. In VHDL, ports with mode `out` are write-only within their own entity. Reading them (as done in `a and b`) violates VHDL's port mode rules.

### Why This Happens
1. **Port Mode Restrictions**:
   - `out` ports can only be **assigned values** (written to)
   - They **cannot be read** inside the same entity
   - Your code tries to read `b` (an `out` port) in the expression `a and b`

2. **Synthesis Tool Enforcement**:
   - The synthesis tool (Xilinx Vivado) explicitly forbids this with error `[Synth 8-1779]`
   - The error suggests using `buffer` or `inout` mode if you need to read the port internally

### Solution
**Change the port mode from `out` to `buffer`** to allow reading the port's value internally. Here's the fixed code:

```vhdl
library ieee;
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity top9 is
    port (
        a : in std_logic;
        b : buffer std_logic  -- CHANGED from 'out' to 'buffer'
    );
end entity top9;

architecture rtl of top9 is
    signal temp_signal : std_logic;
begin
    temp_signal <= a and b;  -- Now legal to read 'b'
end architecture rtl;
```

### Key Notes
1. **`buffer` vs `inout`**:
   - Use `buffer` for simple feedback (output read internally)
   - `inout` is for bidirectional pins (e.g., tri-state buses), which is overkill here

2. **Potential Follow-up Issue**:
   - Your output `b` is still undriven (no assignment to `b`)
   - After fixing the port mode, you'll need to add something like:
     ```vhdl
     b <= temp_signal;  -- Example output driver
     ```
   or connect `b` to a proper value source

### Why This Fix Works
- `buffer` ports maintain their driven value internally, allowing both:
  1. Writing to the port (external output)
  2. Reading the current value (within the entity)
- This complies with VHDL's port mode rules and resolves the synthesis error

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: While `inout` would also technically work, `buffer` is semantically correct for this use case and avoids unnecessary bidirectional signaling complexity.
