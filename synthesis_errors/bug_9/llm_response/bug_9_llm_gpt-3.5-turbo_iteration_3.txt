The bug in the provided code is happening due to the incorrect usage of the signal `b` in the expression `temp_signal <= a and b`. In VHDL, signals declared as `out` in the entity cannot be read (or used on the right-hand side of a signal assignment) directly within the architecture. The error message specifically states that you should use `buffer` or `inout` for such purpose.

To resolve this issue, you can change the type of signal `b` in the entity declaration from `out` to `buffer`. This change will allow the signal `b` to be read within the architecture of the entity.

Revised code snippet:

```vhdl
entity top9 is
    port (
        a : in std_logic;
        b : buffer std_logic
    );
end entity top9;
```

Once you make this simple modification, the error should no longer occur during the simulation of the test bench and code file.
