The error you are encountering is due to the way the signal `b` is declared and used in your VHDL code. The signal `b` is declared as an `out` port, which means it can only be assigned values within this entity and not read within the architecture's use since it's not allowed to read from an `out` port directly. If you try to read from an `out` port, you'll get the error message you mentioned.

The VHDL language does not allow reading from an `out` port because `out` is intended only for driving signals out of an entity. Hence, the line `temp_signal <= a and b;` attempts to read from `b`, which is not permitted.

To fix this issue, you should change the port declaration of `b` to either `buffer` or `inout`. A `buffer` port allows reading from and writing to the signal within the entity, while an `inout` port allows the signal to be driven and read from outside the entity.

Here is how you can modify the code for `b` to be a `buffer`, which would be a more appropriate choice in this context:

```vhdl
entity top9 is
    port (
        a : in std_logic;
        b : buffer std_logic -- Change from 'out' to 'buffer'
    );
end entity top9;

architecture rtl of top9 is
    signal temp_signal : std_logic;
begin
    temp_signal <= a and b;
end architecture rtl;
```

This change allows you to perform the `temp_signal <= a and b;` assignment without any read restriction on `b`. If your design requirements allow, consider whether the `buffer` or `inout` port usage is most appropriate based on how you want `b` to interact outside the entity.

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.
