The error message is indicating that the assignment `temp_signal <= a and b;` is causing an issue because the signal `b` is declared as an output in the entity declaration of `top9`. An output signal (`out`) in VHDL cannot be read from directly in the architecture, as it is intended to be driven by the entity to an external component.

To resolve this issue, you can change the port declaration of signal `b` in the entity from `out` to `inout` or `buffer`. This will allow the signal to be read from and written to within the architecture. Since `b` is an output signal in this context, changing it to `buffer` would be more appropriate if you intend to control the value of `b` within the architecture.

After updating the port declaration in the entity to `b : buffer std_logic`, the assignment `temp_signal <= a and b;` should work correctly without causing the error.
