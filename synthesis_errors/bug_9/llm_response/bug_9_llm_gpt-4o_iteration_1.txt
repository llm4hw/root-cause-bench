The error you are encountering arises from attempting to read from an 'out' mode port in your VHDL code. In VHDL, an 'out' mode port is typically intended for driving output signals and cannot be read within the architecture where it is declared. Specifically, in the line `temp_signal <= a and b;`, the signal `b` is being used as an input to an operation, which is not permissible for a port declared as 'out'.

In VHDL, 'out' ports can only be driven by the architecture or another process and cannot be used as inputs within the same entity. If you need to read the value of 'b', you should declare it with either 'inout' or 'buffer' mode, depending on your design requirements. The 'inout' mode allows bidirectional data flow, while 'buffer' allows reading within the architecture but is less common because it implies specific semantics about driving the signal externally.

The issue occurs because the design attempts to use 'b' as an input to the logic operation (`a and b`) to assign a value to `temp_signal`, while `b` is an 'out' port and thus is only meant to be used as a driver output in the module's context. As per VHDL rules, this operation is not allowed when using 'out' ports.

To resolve the issue, consider changing the declaration of 'b' to 'inout' if you anticipate needing to read and write to it from within the same architecture or different modules. Alternatively, if there is no actual need to drive 'b' from outside, you might consider re-evaluating your architecture to use internal signals appropriately. However, it is important to ensure that the use of 'inout' aligns with your design intentions and does not violate other design constraints or expectations.
