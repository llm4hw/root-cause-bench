The error occurs because the process is mixing two mutually exclusive types of event control. In VHDL, a process that has a sensitivity list (in this case, the signal "clk") should not include a wait statement. When a process includes a sensitivity list, it is automatically triggered by events on the listed signals, and adding an explicit wait statement (like "wait for 10 ns;") creates a conflict in how the process is supposed to be controlled.

This bug is occurring because the VHDL simulator detects that you have both an automatic trigger mechanism (the sensitivity list) and a manual delay (the wait statement) within the same process. The simulator cannot resolve this mixed control flow, so it flags an error during synthesis or simulation.

To fix this issue, you must choose one style of process control:
• Either remove the wait statement and rely entirely on the sensitivity list (or use clock-based control as usual) 
• Or remove the sensitivity list, using only wait statements to manage process timing.

By using only one method, you'll provide a clear control structure to the simulator and resolve the error.
