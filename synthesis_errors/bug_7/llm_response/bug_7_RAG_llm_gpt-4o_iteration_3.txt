The error message you are encountering indicates that the synthesis tool has detected a process that contains both a sensitivity list and a `wait` statement. In VHDL, having both in the same process is not allowed because they serve similar purposes in determining when a process should execute. A sensitivity list specifies the conditions under which a process should be triggered, while a `wait` statement provides the conditions for awaiting execution within a process.

### Root Cause
In your code file, the process is described as follows:
```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        signal1 <= not signal1;
    end if;
    wait for 10 ns;  -- This line causes the error when combined with the sensitivity list
end process;
```
- The sensitivity list `(clk)` indicates this process is triggered on changes to the `clk` signal.
- The `wait for 10 ns;` statement inside the process is attempting to delay execution, but this conflicts with the sensitivity list.

### Solution
To fix this issue, you need to choose between using a sensitivity list or a `wait` statement, but not both. If the objective is to execute at clock edges with a delay, you can organize your logic without a `wait` statement or arrange the delay in a different way. Here's an alternative approach if you solely need to toggle `signal1` on clock edges without the `wait`:

1. **Remove the `wait` statement**:
   ```vhdl
   process (clk)
   begin
       if rising_edge(clk) then
           signal1 <= not signal1;
           -- Removed the wait for 10 ns statement
       end if;
   end process;
   ```

2. **Analogous behavior to `wait for 10 ns;`**:
   If the intended functionality requires a delay beyond toggling on the clock edge, you might need to redesign this with a kind of counter that effectively implements a delay without `wait`.

Remember that the essential structure of a process that infers sequential logic typically focuses on the clock and avoids the need for explicit waits, instead structuring broader timing behavior through additional state logic or separate processes where necessary.

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: NOTE: The Verilog language does not have a true “sensitivity list”.  Instead,
the @ time control at the beginning of a procedure delays the execution of all

Thus, if the @ control is the first thing in the procedure, the entire procedure
appears to be sensitive to changes in the signals listed. The @ token is a time
control, however, and not a true sensitivity list.  An edge-sensitive time...

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.
always @ (signal1, signal2)

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-ﬂip-ﬂops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
