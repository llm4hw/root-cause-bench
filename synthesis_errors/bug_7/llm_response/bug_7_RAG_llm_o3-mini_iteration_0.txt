The bug is that the process uses both a sensitivity list (clk) and an explicit wait statement ("wait for 10 ns;"). In VHDL, a process must either use a sensitivity list or explicit wait statements—using both in the same process is not allowed. The synthesis and simulation tools therefore produce an error.

This issue occurs because when you specify a sensitivity list (here, the process is triggered on clk events), the process automatically waits for events on the specified signals. Adding an explicit "wait for 10 ns;" conflicts with the sensitivity mechanism, as the process would then have two different methods to control its execution timing.

To fix the error, you need to choose one method. For a clocked (synchronous) process, you should remove the explicit wait statement so that the process only uses the sensitivity list. If you need to control timing within a process (for testing purposes, for example), consider removing the sensitivity list and rely solely on wait statements. However, for typical synchronous logic, simply removing the wait statement is the correct fix.

For example, the corrected process should look like this:

-------------------------------------------------
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        signal1 <= not signal1;
    end if;
end process;
-------------------------------------------------

This modification keeps the process synchronous with the clk signal and resolves the error message.

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: NOTE: The Verilog language does not have a true “sensitivity list”.  Instead,
the @ time control at the beginning of a procedure delays the execution of all

Thus, if the @ control is the first thing in the procedure, the entire procedure
appears to be sensitive to changes in the signals listed. The @ token is a time
control, however, and not a true sensitivity list.  An edge-sensitive time...

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-ﬂip-ﬂops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
