The error occurs because the VHDL process combines two incompatible constructs: a sensitivity list and a `wait` statement. Here's why this is problematic:

1. **Fundamental Conflict**:  
   VHDL processes must exclusively use either:
   - A **sensitivity list** (e.g., `process(clk)`) where the process wakes up *only* when signals in the list change, or
   - **Wait statements** (e.g., `wait for 10 ns;`) where the process controls its own suspension/resumption.  
   Combining both creates ambiguous behavior for simulation/synthesis tools.

2. **Specific Issue in the Code**:  
   The process has:
   - A sensitivity list (`(clk)`) requiring it to execute on every `clk` change
   - A `wait for 10 ns;` statement attempting to suspend execution for 10 ns  
   Synthesis tools cannot map this mixed behavior to hardware, as real flip-flops (implied by `rising_edge(clk)`) don't support arbitrary `wait` delays.

3. **Simulation vs. Synthesis**:  
   While some simulators might allow this (with undefined behavior), synthesis tools strictly reject it because:
   - The `wait for` statement implies a timed delay, which has no physical counterpart in digital hardware
   - The sensitivity list expects edge-triggered logic (flip-flops)

**How to Fix**:  
Remove the `wait for 10 ns;` line entirely. The process should only contain synchronous logic controlled by the clock edge. The corrected process will behave as a standard flip-flop that toggles `signal1` on each rising clock edge without artificial delays. If a 10 ns timing requirement exists (e.g., for output stability), it must be handled through clock frequency or external timing constraintsâ€”*not* via in-process delays.
