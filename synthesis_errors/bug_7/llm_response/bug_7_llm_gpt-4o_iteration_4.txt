The error message you are encountering is due to an illegal construct in VHDL. In VHDL, a process can either use a sensitivity list or a `wait` statement, but not both. A sensitivity list describes events that trigger the process to execute, while a `wait` statement controls when and for how long the process suspends execution.

In the code you provided, the process is declared with a sensitivity to the `clk` signal:

```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        signal1 <= not signal1;
    end if;
    wait for 10 ns;
end process;
```

Inside this process, there's also a `wait for 10 ns;` statement. The combination of these two constructs is not allowed, leading to the error message `process cannot have both a wait statement and a sensitivity list`. This restriction exists because they both serve as mechanisms to control the process's execution flow, but they do so in potentially conflicting ways.

To resolve this error, you should choose one of the two mechanisms based on the desired functionality:

1. **If you want the process to execute only in response to a clock edge (sequential logic):** Use the sensitivity list and remove the `wait` statement. This approach is typically used for synchronous logic driven by the clock.

2. **If you want to use time-based delays within the process (purely combinatorial logic):** Remove the sensitivity list and rely on the `wait` statement.

Given that your current code structure implies that you want to perform actions on the rising edge of `clk`, it seems like it should be a synchronous process responding to clock edges. Therefore, the appropriate action would be to remove the `wait for 10 ns;` statement. 

This approach aligns with common design practices for synchronous circuits, where the transition of the signal is controlled by the clock without arbitrary delays.
