The error message you're encountering is due to the presence of both a sensitivity list and a `wait` statement within the same process, which is not allowed in VHDL. This error arises because when you use a sensitivity list, it is intended to react to changes in the signals specified within the list, and using a `wait` statement within such a process contradicts the purpose of the sensitivity list.

### Explanation:

1. **Sensitivity List:** The `process (clk)` line begins a process that is sensitive to the `clk` signal. This means the process is triggered every time a change (specifically, the rising edge if specified) happens to `clk`. 

2. **Wait Statement:** The `wait for 10 ns;` line introduces a delay, causing the process to wait for 10 nanoseconds before continuing its execution. 

In VHDL, a process can operate based on:
- A sensitivity list which specifies the conditions under which the process is triggered.
- A `wait` statement that provides explicit control over timing and execution.

Mixing these two concepts results in conflicts because using a wait in a process suggests you want to control timing within the process manually, which makes a sensitivity list redundant and contradictory.

### Fix:

To fix the error, you should remove the sensitivity list and rely on the wait mechanism exclusively if you want to control timing precisely. Here's how you can modify the code:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top7 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
begin
    process
    begin
        wait until rising_edge(clk);
        signal1 <= not signal1;  -- Flips `signal1` every clock cycle at rising edge
        wait for 10 ns;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

### Rationale for the Fix:

By removing `(clk)` from the process definition and using `wait until rising_edge(clk);`, you remove the inconsistency. You can now use `wait for 10 ns;` without any conflicts, thereby aligning the process to operate entirely on explicit wait conditions, controlling timing accurately within the simulation environment.

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: NOTE: The Verilog language does not have a true “sensitivity list”.  Instead,
the @ time control at the beginning of a procedure delays the execution of all
statements within the procedure until an edge occurs on the signals listed.
Thus, if the @ control is the first thing in the procedure, the entire procedure
appears to be sensitive to changes in the signals listed. The @ token is a time
control, however, and not a true sensitivity list.  An edge-sensitive time...

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-ﬂip-ﬂops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
