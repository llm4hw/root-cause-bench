The bug is that the process is mixing two mutually exclusive styles for controlling execution. The process header includes a sensitivity list (clk) and, inside the process, there is a "wait for 10 ns" statement. In VHDL, you cannot combine a sensitivity list with an explicit wait statement inside the same process.

Why is it occurring?
• When you specify a sensitivity list (e.g., process(clk)), the simulator/synthesizer expects that the process will automatically trigger on changes to the listed signals.
• The addition of a wait statement (especially with a time delay) conflicts with that expectation since wait statements are used to control the simulation time explicitly in processes that do not have a sensitivity list.
• As a result, the tool generates the error, stating that the process cannot have both a wait statement and a sensitivity list.

How can it be fixed?
You have two options:
1. Remove the sensitivity list:
  • Rewrite the process without a sensitivity list and control when the process wakes using only wait statements.
  • For example:
   process
   begin
    wait until rising_edge(clk);
    signal1 <= not signal1;
    wait for 10 ns;
   end process;
2. Remove the wait statement:
  • Since the process is intended to use a clock edge for synchronization, you can remove the "wait for 10 ns;" line.
  • This makes the process purely edge-triggered.
  • For example:
   process (clk)
   begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
     signal1 <= not signal1;
    end if;
   end process;

Either option will resolve the conflict. The best choice depends on whether you need the explicit timing delay within the process or if the clock-based synchronization is sufficient for your design.

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: NOTE: The Verilog language does not have a true “sensitivity list”.  Instead,
the @ time control at the beginning of a procedure delays the execution of all
statements within the procedure until an edge occurs on the signals listed.
Thus, if the @ control is the first thing in the procedure, the entire procedure
appears to be sensitive to changes in the signals listed. The @ token is a time
control, however, and not a true sensitivity list.  An edge-sensitive time...

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-ﬂip-ﬂops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
