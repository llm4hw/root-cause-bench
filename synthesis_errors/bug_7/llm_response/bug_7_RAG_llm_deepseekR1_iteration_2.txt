The error occurs because in VHDL, a process **cannot contain both a sensitivity list and a `wait` statement**. This violates fundamental synthesis and simulation rules. Here's the breakdown:

### Root Cause:
1. **Conflicting Trigger Mechanisms**:
   - The sensitivity list `(clk)` makes the process execute **whenever `clk` changes**.
   - The `wait for 10 ns;` statement tries to pause execution for 10 ns after each trigger.
   - These two approaches are mutually exclusive. A process must use **either** a sensitivity list **or** explicit `wait` statements, not both.

2. **Synthesis Limitation**:
   - Synthesis tools cannot map this hybrid behavior to hardware. Flip-flops (implied by `rising_edge(clk)`) cannot coexist with arbitrary timing delays (`wait for 10 ns`) in the same process.

### Fix:
**Remove the `wait for 10 ns;` statement**. The corrected process should only use the sensitivity list and clock edge detection:
```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        signal1 <= not signal1;
    end if;
end process;
```

### Why This Works:
- The sensitivity list `(clk)` ensures the process runs on every clock change.
- The `rising_edge(clk)` check isolates the flip-flop behavior to the clock's rising edge.
- The process naturally suspends after the `if` block, waiting for the next `clk` event (no explicit `wait` needed).

### Corrected Code:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top7 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
begin
    process (clk)
    begin
        if rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
        -- WAIT STATEMENT REMOVED
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

### Additional Notes:
- **Reset Consideration**: Add a reset if needed (e.g., initialize `signal1` to `'0'` when `rst` is active).
- **Simulation vs. Synthesis**: `wait for` is generally unusable in synthesizable code. Use it only in testbenches (without sensitivity lists).

This change resolves the synthesis error and maintains the intended toggle-flop behavior.

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: NOTE: The Verilog language does not have a true “sensitivity list”.  Instead,
the @ time control at the beginning of a procedure delays the execution of all
statements within the procedure until an edge occurs on the signals listed.
Thus, if the @ control is the first thing in the procedure, the entire procedure
appears to be sensitive to changes in the signals listed. The @ token is a time
control, however, and not a true sensitivity list.  An edge-sensitive time...

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.

list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-ﬂip-ﬂops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
