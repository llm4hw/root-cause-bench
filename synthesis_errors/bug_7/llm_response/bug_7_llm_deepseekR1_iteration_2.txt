### Issue Explanation:

The error occurs because the VHDL process contains **both a sensitivity list and a `wait` statement**, which violates fundamental VHDL rules. Here's why:

1. **Mutually Exclusive Constructs**:
   - A process can **either**:
     - Use a **sensitivity list** (e.g., `process(clk)`) to trigger execution when listed signals change, **or**
     - Use **`wait` statements** (e.g., `wait for 10 ns`) to control execution flow explicitly.
   - Combining both in the same process creates ambiguity in execution control and is prohibited by the VHDL standard.

2. **Synthesis Conflict**:
   - Hardware synthesis tools cannot map a process with `wait for` statements to physical logic. `wait for` is a simulation-only construct for timing delays, which has no equivalent in digital hardware.

3. **Behavioral Conflict**:
   - The sensitivity list `(clk)` expects the process to trigger on clock edges, but the `wait for 10 ns` forces a fixed delay unrelated to clock behavior. This creates undefined timing behavior.

### Root Cause:
The process attempts to function as both:
- An **edge-triggered sequential process** (via `rising_edge(clk)` and sensitivity to `clk`), and  
- A **timed delay process** (via `wait for 10 ns`).

These paradigms are fundamentally incompatible in a single process.

### Fix Approach:
1. **Remove the `wait for 10 ns` statement** entirely.  
   - The sensitivity list `(clk)` and `rising_edge(clk)` already provide correct clock-edge behavior.  
   - The `wait` statement serves no functional purpose here and prevents synthesis.

2. **Ensure the process contains only synthesizable constructs**:
   - Keep the `if rising_edge(clk)` block for flip-flop behavior.  
   - Remove all simulation-only timing controls (like `wait for`).

After removal, the process will correctly model a clock-driven flip-flop without synthesis errors. The signal will toggle on every clock edge as intended.
