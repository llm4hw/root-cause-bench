The error message indicates a fundamental issue with the use of the `wait` statement within a process that also has a sensitivity list specified in VHDL. In VHDL, a process cannot utilize both a sensitivity list and a `wait` statement. This is because each process must have precisely one method of determining when its statements should execute:

1. **Sensitivity List:** Causes the process to execute whenever there is an event (a change) on one of the signals in the list.
2. **Wait Statement:** Allows for explicit control of when the process will pause or resume, effectively replacing the sensitivity list with explicit timing control.

**Bug Explanation:**
- In the provided code, the process is sensitive to the `clk` signal due to the sensitivity list `(clk)` at the beginning of the process.
- Inside the process, a `wait for 10 ns;` statement is also used. This results in a conflict because the process cannot have both the sensitivity list mechanism and use a `wait` statement to control execution timing.

**Solution:**
To fix the issue, you need to choose either the sensitivity list or use `wait` statements alone to control the process execution timing:

- If you wish to use the rising edge of the clock as the control, remove the `wait for 10 ns;` statement and stick with just the sensitivity list.
  
  ```vhdl
  process (clk)
  begin
      if rising_edge(clk) then
          signal1 <= not signal1;
      end if;
      -- wait for 10 ns;  <-- Remove this line
  end process;
  ```

- Alternatively, if you want to implement a delay-based mechanism (not recommended for clock-driven processes in a real design), remove the sensitivity list and employ only `wait` statements. However, for clock-driven logic, using rising/falling edge with a sensitivity list is typical.

Since the original intention seems to be driven by the clock edge (rising_edge(clk)), the best approach is to keep the sensitivity list and remove the `wait for 10 ns;` statement.

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: NOTE: The Verilog language does not have a true “sensitivity list”.  Instead,
the @ time control at the beginning of a procedure delays the execution of all
statements within the procedure until an edge occurs on the signals listed.
Thus, if the @ control is the first thing in the procedure, the entire procedure
appears to be sensitive to changes in the signals listed. The @ token is a time
control, however, and not a true sensitivity list.  An edge-sensitive time...

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-ﬂip-ﬂops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
