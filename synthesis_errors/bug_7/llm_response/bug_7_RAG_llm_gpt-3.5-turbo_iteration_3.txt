The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-2578] process cannot have both a wait statement and a sensitivity list" occurs because in the given code snippet, there is a process sensitive to the `clk` signal that contains a `wait for 10 ns;` statement along with the sensitivity list `process (clk)`. 

Processes in VHDL can either include a sensitivity list (sensitive to certain signals) or use a wait statement, but not both together within the same process. In this case, having both causes a conflict.

To fix this issue, you can remove the `wait for 10 ns;` statement from the process block as it is unnecessary due to the presence of the clock edge sensitivity in the process. Here is the modified process block without the `wait for` statement:

```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        signal1 <= not signal1;
    end if;
end process;
```

By making this change, the error related to having both a wait statement and a sensitivity list in the same process should be resolved, and the code should function correctly during simulation.

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: NOTE: The Verilog language does not have a true “sensitivity list”.  Instead,
the @ time control at the beginning of a procedure delays the execution of all
statements within the procedure until an edge occurs on the signals listed.
Thus, if the @ control is the first thing in the procedure, the entire procedure
appears to be sensitive to changes in the signals listed. The @ token is a time
control, however, and not a true sensitivity list.  An edge-sensitive time...

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-ﬂip-ﬂops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
