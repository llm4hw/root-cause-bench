The bug in the provided code is due to the presence of both a `wait for` statement within the process and a sensitivity list in the process statement. In VHDL, a process cannot have both a `wait` statement and a sensitivity list.

The error message "process cannot have both a wait statement and a sensitivity list" occurs because the process in the code contains both a sensitivity list `(clk)` and a `wait for 10 ns;` statement within its body.

To fix this issue, you need to decide whether the process should be sensitive to the clock signal `clk` or if it should rely on the `wait for` statement for timing control. If the process is intended to be clocked, you should remove the `wait for 10 ns;` statement. If timing control is based on the `wait for` statement, then the sensitivity list `(clk)` should be removed from the process statement. 

You should make sure that the process is properly synchronized with the clock signal if it is intended to be clocked. Otherwise, if timing control is based on the `wait for` statement for simulation purposes, remove the sensitivity list from the process.
