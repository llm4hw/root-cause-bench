Based on the provided context and error analysis, here's the breakdown of the issue and solution:

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Invalid Combination**: The error occurs because a VHDL process **cannot simultaneously contain both a sensitivity list (`process(clk)`) and a `wait` statement (`wait for 10 ns`). These are mutually exclusive process triggering mechanisms.
   
2. **Synthesis Rule Violation**: Synthesis tools require deterministic hardware mapping. A sensitivity list implies event-triggered execution (e.g., clock edges), while `wait` implies time-based execution. Combining them creates ambiguous behavior that can't be synthesized to hardware.

3. **Contradiction in Logic**:
   - The sensitivity list `(clk)` makes the process execute **only on clock changes**
   - The `wait for 10 ns` forces a **fixed time delay** between executions
   - These conflict fundamentally in how they control process activation

### Fix Implementation:
Remove the `wait` statement entirely since the sensitivity list and `rising_edge` check already provide proper clock-triggered behavior:

```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        signal1 <= not signal1;
    end if;
    -- REMOVE THIS LINE: wait for 10 ns;
end process;
```

### Why This Fix Works:
1. **Hardware Consistency**: The process now cleanly describes a clock-synchronized flip-flop:
   - Activated exclusively on `clk` changes
   - Checks for rising edges
   - Performs synchronous assignment (`signal1` toggle)

2. **Synthesis Compliance**: Matches standard sequential logic template:
   - Sensitivity list contains only clock
   - No time-based controls (`wait` removed)
   - Edge detection via `rising_edge()`

3. **Preserved Functionality**: Maintains the original intent of toggling `signal1` on each clock edge without artificial delays.

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Add Reset Handling** (Best practice):
```vhdl
process (clk)
begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
        if rst = '1' then      -- Add reset condition
            signal1 <= '0';
        else
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end if;
end process;
```

2. **Avoid Time Delays in Synthesizable Code**: `wait for` statements are generally only usable in testbenches, not in synthesizable hardware descriptions.

> **Note**: The error occurred during synthesis (Xilinx tool error code `[Synth 8-2578]`), not simulation. The fix ensures the code can be properly synthesized to hardware.

5.1.1.3 Sensitivity Lists
A sensitivity list is used in conjunction with a procedural block to trigger when the assignments within
the block are executed. The symbol @ is used to indicate a sensitivity list. Signals can then be listed
within parenthesis after the @ symbol that will trigger the procedural block. The following is the base
syntax for a sensitivity list.

list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Does RTL modeling synthesize as combinational logic, sequential logic, or both? Why?
(A)
Combinational logic. Since only one process is used for each register, it will be
synthesized using basic gates.
(B)
Sequential logic. Since the sensitivity list contains clock and reset, it will
synthesize into only D-Ô¨Çip-Ô¨Çops.
(C)
Both. The model has a sensitivity list containing clock and reset and uses an...
