The issue arises because the process contains both a sensitivity list (in this case, the clock signal) and a wait statement ("wait for 10 ns;"). In VHDL, using a sensitivity list tells the simulation engine that the process should be activated automatically whenever one of the signals in the list changes. However, when you include a wait statement inside that process, it creates conflicting control flows for process activation. The simulation tool does not allow a process to be governed by both the sensitivity list and an internal wait statement, which is why the error is raised.

Essentially, the error occurs because the VHDL standard requires you to choose one method for controlling when the process is executed: either by listing the signals to monitor (sensitivity list) or by explicitly using one or more wait statements inside the process. Mixing them leads to confusion in simulation scheduling and synthesis.

In order to resolve the issue, you would need to remove the conflict by either eliminating the wait statement (if you intend to trigger the process solely based on changes in the sensitivity list) or by removing the sensitivity list and relying solely on wait statements to control the process execution.
