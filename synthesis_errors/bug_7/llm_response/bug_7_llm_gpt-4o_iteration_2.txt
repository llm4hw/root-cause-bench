The error message indicates that there is a conflict in the VHDL process statement due to the use of both a sensitivity list and a `wait` statement within the same process. In VHDL, a process can either have a sensitivity list or use wait statements to control execution timing, but not both.

In the provided code file, the process is defined with a sensitivity list containing `clk`. However, inside the process, there is also a `wait for 10 ns;` statement. This wait statement is causing the synthesis tool to raise an error because mixing a sensitivity list and a wait statement in the same process is illegal in VHDL.

The reason this bug occurs is due to mismanagement of how process timing control is handled. When you have a sensitivity list, you're telling the simulator to only wake this process up when one of the signals in the list changes. Conversely, a wait statement explicitly manages when the process should pause and resume. Combining both can lead to ambiguous and unpredictable behavior during simulation, hence the error.

To resolve this issue, you need to choose one method of timing control. If the design is clock-driven, you should remove the `wait for 10 ns;` statement and rely solely on the clock edge detection (i.e., the rising edge of `clk`) as the mechanism to control timing within this process. This aligns with typical synchronous design practices where changes in state occur in relation to clock edges. By doing so, you maintain a single method of control, well-defined behavior, and compatibility with synthesis tools.
