The error occurs because the process is declared with a sensitivity list (in this case, associated with the clock signal) but also contains an explicit wait statement ("wait for 10 ns;"). In VHDL, you must choose one scheme to control process execution: either use a sensitivity list or use wait statements, but not both in the same process. Their simultaneous use confuses the simulator about what should trigger the process and when it should suspend or resume.

Essentially, the presence of the sensitivity list already tells the simulator that it should execute the process whenever the signals in the list change. Adding an explicit wait statement inside the same process (which instructs the simulator to pause execution until a specified simulation time has elapsed) creates a conflict. The tool enforces this by throwing an error.

To fix the issue, you need to choose one method of process control. You might either remove the wait statement if you want the process to respond solely to changes in the sensitivity list (for instance, keeping it synchronous with the clock) or remove the sensitivity list and rely solely on wait statements for process control. This adjustment will resolve the conflict that is triggering the error message.
