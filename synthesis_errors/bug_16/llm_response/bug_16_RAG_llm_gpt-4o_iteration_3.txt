The error message you are encountering is related to the improper use of an asynchronous set/reset in the 'top16' module. The error is likely occurring because the synthesis tool is unable to map the line `out1 = data;` to a register operation due to the nature of its assignment within the `always` block structure that includes asynchronous control.

### Issue:

1. **Assignment Type**: The error arises due to a mismatch in using blocking (`=`) assignment inside a sequential `always` block that is sensitive to both clock (`clk`) and reset (`rst`). In synchronous designs, non-blocking assignments (`<=`) should be used for signals that represent state elements (i.e., flip-flops or registers) to ensure correct sequential behavior.

2. **Asynchronous Reset Handling**: When you are using an asynchronous reset in a synthesizable block, all register operations must be cleanly mapped to ensure that synthesis can create the expected behavior. The use of blocking assignment suggests combinational behavior which conflicts with expectations for a register with asynchronous reset.

### Solution:

Convert blocking assignments to non-blocking assignments in your always block when dealing with assignments that are intended to represent flip-flop behavior:

```verilog
module top16(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);

    reg data;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            data <= 1'b0;  // Use non-blocking assignment for flip-flops
        else
            data <= ~data; // Use non-blocking assignment for flip-flops
        out1 <= data;      // Use non-blocking assignment for flip-flops
    end

//    assign out1 = data;

endmodule
```

By using non-blocking assignments (`<=`), you allow the synthesis tool to correctly treat `data` and `out1` as sequential elements with respect to `clk` and `rst`, solving the problem with asynchronous reset extraction.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
