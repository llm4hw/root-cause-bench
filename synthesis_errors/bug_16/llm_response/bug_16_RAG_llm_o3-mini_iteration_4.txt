The error occurs because the always block is describing sequential (clocked) logic with an asynchronous reset using mixed assignment types. In this code, the register updates are done inconsistently:

• The reset branch uses a nonblocking assignment (data <= 1'b0), which is appropriate for sequential logic.
• The clocked (else) branch uses a blocking assignment (data = ~data) and then updates out1 with a blocking assignment (out1 = data).

Using blocking assignments inside an always block that is sensitive to an edge of clk (and asynchronous reset) can prevent the synthesis tool from correctly “extracting” (or inferring) the asynchronous reset for registers. In other words, because out1 (and data) are updated with blocking assignments (or a mix of blocking and nonblocking assignments), the synthesis tool sees a combinational dependency that doesn’t match the standard style for registers with an asynchronous reset.

The fix is to use nonblocking assignments consistently for all the registers updated in a clocked process. That is, change:
  data = ~data;  and  out1 = data;
to:
  data <= ~data;  and  out1 <= data;

A corrected version of the always block would be:

  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
   if (rst) begin
    data <= 1'b0;
   end else begin
    data <= ~data;
   end
   out1 <= data;
  end

This ensures that both registers (data and out1) have a proper asynchronous reset and that the synthesis tool can correctly infer the reset logic.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
