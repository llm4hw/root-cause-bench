Based on the error message and analysis of your Verilog code, the bug occurs due to improper handling of asynchronous reset in the sequential logic block. Here's the breakdown:

### Root Cause:
1. **Mixed Blocking/Non-blocking Assignments**: 
   - `data` uses non-blocking (`<=`) assignment in reset but blocking (`=`) assignment in clock logic
   - `out1` uses blocking assignment (`=`) in both cases
   
2. **Incomplete Reset Logic**:
   - The asynchronous reset only resets `data`, not `out1`
   - Synthesis tool cannot infer reset behavior for `out1_reg`

3. **Procedural Block Issues**:
   - Edge-triggered always blocks require non-blocking assignments for sequential logic
   - Blocking assignments cause unpredictable behavior in clocked blocks

### Fixed Code:
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top16(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1  // Keep as reg for procedural assignment
);

    reg data;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst) begin
            data <= 1'b0;
            out1 <= 1'b0;  // Reset both signals
        end
        else begin
            data <= ~data;   // Non-blocking assignment
            out1 <= data;    // Non-blocking assignment
        end
    end

endmodule
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Consistent Non-blocking Assignments**:
   - Changed all assignments to `<=` in clocked block
   - Ensures proper sequential logic implementation

2. **Complete Reset Handling**:
   - Added `out1` reset (same as `data`)
   - Resolves synthesis error about missing reset

3. **Correct Procedural Logic**:
   - The `out1 <= data` assignment properly laches previous value of `data`
   - Maintains one-clock delay between `data` toggle and `out1` update

### Explanation:
The original code created uncertainty for the synthesis tool:
1. `out1` wasn't reset while being in a reset-sensitive block
2. Blocking assignments caused race conditions between `data` and `out1`
3. Mixed assignment types prevented proper flip-flop inference

The fix ensures:
- Clean reset propagation for all registers
- Proper clocked behavior using non-blocking assignments
- Synthesizable sequential logic that matches simulation
- Elimination of the "[Synth 8-6842]" error

> 💡 **Important Note**: The `out1 <= data` assignment intentionally creates a 1-clock delay between `data` toggle and output. If you need immediate propagation, use `assign out1 = data` and remove `out1` from the always block (but then it wouldn't be reset synchronously).

the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
