The error you're encountering, "Cannot extract Asynchronous Set/Reset for register 'out1_reg' in module 'top16'," is related to the use and handling of blocking assignments in your always block. This issue typically arises when the synthesis tool cannot map the logic to a reliable flip-flop with an asynchronous reset capability because of the way assignments are structured in the code.

### Issue Explanation:

1. **Blocking vs. Non-blocking Assignments:**
   - In the Verilog code provided, there is a mix of non-blocking (`<=`) and blocking (`=`) assignments within the same always block. Specifically, `data <= 1'b0;` uses a non-blocking assignment on reset, while `data = ~data;` and `out1 = data;` use blocking assignments.
   - Blocking assignments (`=`) are executed immediately, whereas non-blocking assignments (`<=`) are scheduled to occur at the end of the current time step. This means that the value of `data` during the execution of `out1 = data;` could be inconsistent or unexpected because of the immediate update caused by the blocking assignment.

2. **Asynchronous Reset Handling:**
   - The error message suggests that the synthesis tool is unable to infer a proper asynchronous reset for the `out1` register. This could be due to the fact that since `out1` is assigned using a blocking assignment `out1 = data`, it doesn't have a clear reset behavior that can be extracted by the synthesis tool.

### Root Cause:

The inconsistency in assignment types within the always block coupled with the tool's inability to deduce a valid async reset signal for `out1` leads to this error. The immediate update of `out1` using a blocking assignment does not give room for the reset behavior to be properly synthesized, especially in a scenario where asynchronous control is expected.

### How the Bug Could Be Addressed:

Without providing the direct code fix, an effective way to address such a problem involves:

- Ensuring consistency in assignment types within the always block to prevent unexpected behavior and synthesis errors. Using consistent non-blocking assignments (`<=`) for all signal updates in always blocks dealing with sequential logic is a standard practice.
- Consider incorporating the reset condition directly into the sequential logic update (non-blocking manner), ensuring that all dependent signals like `out1` are updated correctly in relation to a positive clock edge or reset condition.

By ensuring that the sequential logic follows these principles, the synthesizer will correctly deduce the register requirements, including any asynchronous reset functionality, without encountering extraction issues.
