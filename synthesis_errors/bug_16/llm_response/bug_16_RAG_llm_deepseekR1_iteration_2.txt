The bug in your Verilog code is related to improper handling of asynchronous reset and incorrect use of blocking assignments in a sequential logic block. Here's the breakdown:

### Root Cause:
1. **Missing Reset for Output Register**: 
   - The output register `out1` is not reset when `rst` is asserted. The reset condition only clears `data`, but `out1` remains uninitialized during reset.
   
2. **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignment Conflict**:
   - `data` uses non-blocking assignment (`<=`) in reset but blocking assignment (`=`) in the toggle operation, causing synthesis confusion.
   - `out1` uses blocking assignment (`=`) which treats it as combinational logic, conflicting with the flip-flop inference expected for a clocked block.

3. **Asynchronous Reset Extraction Failure**:
   - Synthesis tools expect all registers in an asynchronous reset block to share the same reset control. `out1` lacks reset handling, causing the error.

### Fix:
Modify the `always` block to:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        data <= 1'b0;
        out1 <= 1'b0;  // Reset both registers
    end
    else begin
        data <= ~data;  // Use non-blocking for sequential logic
        out1 <= data;   // Consistent non-blocking assignment
    end
end
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Reset Both Registers**: Added `out1` reset to match `data`.
2. **Non-Blocking Everywhere**: Changed all assignments to non-blocking (`<=`) for sequential logic consistency.
3. **Correct Data Propagation**: `out1` now properly follows `data` with one-cycle delay (standard flip-flop behavior).

### Why This Works:
- Synchronizes reset handling for all registers in the block
- Uses proper non-blocking assignments for sequential logic
- Maintains clear flip-flop inference for synthesis
- Eliminates mixed blocking/non-blocking conflicts

### Fixed Code:
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top16(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);

    reg data;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            data <= 1'b0;
            out1 <= 1'b0;  // Reset both
        end
        else begin
            data <= ~data;  // Non-blocking toggle
            out1 <= data;   // Non-blocking output
        end
    end

endmodule
```

This will synthesize correctly with:
- `data` as a toggle flip-flop
- `out1` as a buffer register
- Clean asynchronous reset for both registers
- No latch inference or reset extraction errors

the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
