The error message you are encountering indicates a problem with asynchronous reset handling for the register `out1_reg` in the module `top16`. The warning is caused by a misuse of blocking assignments (`=`) within an always block that is triggered by both a clock and reset condition, which can lead to synthesis issues specifically related to asynchronous set/resets.

### Root Cause:

1. **Blocking vs. Non-blocking Assignments:** 
   - In your Verilog code, you are using a blocking assignment (`=`) for `data` and `out1` within the always block. 
   - Blocking assignments (`=`) should typically not be used for sequential logic within a clocked process or when there's a sensitivity list including both clock and reset signals. They execute immediately and not in sequence, which is not suitable for hardware description in the context of flip-flops that should be updated only on clock edges.

2. **Asynchronous Reset:**
   - You have a posedge (positive edge) triggered always block using both `clk` and `rst`. When reset is asynchronous, it should only affect state immediately without waiting for a clock edge. However, by using blocking assignments, the tool cannot map this behavior reliably to hardware that supports geared to desirable asynchronous reset.
   
### Solution:

To fix the issue, you need to switch the blocking assignments to non-blocking assignments (`<=`) inside the always block. Non-blocking assignments ensure that outputs are only evaluated at the end of the current simulation time step (appropriate for flip-flops), preserving signal dependencies.

Here is a corrected version of the `top16` module:

```verilog
module top16(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);

    reg data;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            data <= 1'b0;
        else
            data <= ~data;  // Use non-blocking assignment for sequential logic
        out1 <= data;  // Use non-blocking assignment for sequential logic
    end

endmodule
```

By making this change, your code will correctly use non-blocking assignments for the sequential components of your design, allowing the synthesis tool to properly map the asynchronous reset behavior to the hardware.

the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
