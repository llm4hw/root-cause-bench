Based on the error message, it appears that the issue is related to the synthesis tool not being able to extract an Asynchronous Set/Reset for the register `out1_reg` in module `top16`. This is likely due to the fact that you have both a synchronous logic block (`always @(posedge clk)`) and an asynchronous logic block (`always @(posedge rst)`) operating on the same signal `out1`, which could cause ambiguity and lead to synthesis issues.

To resolve this issue, you should separate the asynchronous reset logic from the synchronous logic. One common approach is to use a synchronous reset rather than an asynchronous one, especially when targeting FPGA synthesis tools. Here's how you can modify your code to use a synchronous reset:

1. Change the sensitivity list of the `always` block to only `posedge clk` to make it synchronous:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if (rst)
        data <= 1'b0;
    else
        data = ~data;
    out1 <= data;
end
```

2. Remove the asynchronous reset signal from the sensitivity list and the logic, which eliminates the possibility of the asynchronous reset conflicting with the synchronous logic.

This modification should help you resolve the extraction error related to the asynchronous set/reset for the register `out1_reg` in module `top16`.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
