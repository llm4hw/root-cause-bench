The error message indicates an issue with the asynchronous set/reset for the register 'out1_reg'. In the Verilog code provided, the problem is directly related to the flip-flop `out1` driven by the register `data` without proper asynchronous set/reset handling.

To fix this issue, you should modify the code snippet where the `out1` output is assigned. Instead of directly using `out1 = data;`, you can use a non-blocking assignment to ensure proper synthesis and simulation behavior with asynchronous set/reset signals. This error often occurs when the flip-flop output is driven directly from a combinatorial block that is not sensitive to the reset signal.

Here's how you can correct the assignment for `out1`:
Replace:
```verilog
out1 = data;
```
with:
```verilog
always @*
begin
    out1 <= data;
end
```
By making this change and using a non-blocking assignment (`<=`), you ensure that `out1` is updated in a synchronous and reliable manner based on changes in `data`, properly including the reset signal in the design. This modification should resolve the error related to the asynchronous set/reset for the register 'out1_reg'.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
