The error message indicates that the synthesis tool is unable to extract an asynchronous set/reset condition for the register 'out1_reg'. This specifically points to the handling of 'out1' inside the always block. The issue is related to how 'data' is being assigned and how 'out1' is updated:

### Bug and Cause:
1. **Blocking Assignment in Asynchronous Control**: In the given code, `out1` is being assigned using a blocking assignment (`=`) rather than `<=`. Blocking assignments should generally not be used for sequential logic that is driven by clock or reset edges, as they can create unexpected behavior by not allowing the timing and dependencies to be managed properly across different clock cycles.

2. **Improper Usage of Blocking Assignments**: Both `data = ~data;` and `out1 = data;` are using blocking assignments, which means that they execute in sequence as they appear without waiting for the rest of the block's assignments to finish. This can potentially lead to timing issues with how 'data' and 'out1' are expected to behave during synthesis.

3. **Sensitive List Order**: The sensitive list is using both `posedge clk` and `posedge rst`. While this is typical for an asynchronous reset, if the tool cannot identify it correctly due to the assignments style (blocking) within the always block, it could lead to an error.

### Fix:
To address this, convert blocking assignments to non-blocking assignments where sequential logic is concerned:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
begin
    if (rst)
        data <= 1'b0;     // Use non-blocking assignment
    else
        data <= ~data;    // Use non-blocking assignment
    out1 <= data;         // Change this to non-blocking assignment
end
```

- Replace `=` with `<=` for `data` and `out1` inside the always block, ensuring that the correct sequential logic behavior is synthesized properly.
- This ensures that assignments to `data` and `out1` are synchronized with the clock edges, maintaining the intended flip-flop behavior with respect to the clocking, adequately handling both the reset and regular operational conditions.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
