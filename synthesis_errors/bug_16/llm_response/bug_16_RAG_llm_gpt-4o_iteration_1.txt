The error message you are encountering indicates a problem with synthesizing an asynchronous set/reset for the register `out1_reg` in your module `top16`. The root cause of this error is related to how the signal `out1` is being updated in your code. Specifically, the issue arises from the fact that the statement `out1 = data;` is using blocking assignment inside an always block that has conditions for asynchronous reset.

### Explanation:
1. **Blocking vs Non-blocking Assignments**: In Verilog, blocking assignments (`=`) are used inside combinational logic blocks to determine the sequence of execution of statements. Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) are typically used in synchronous logic to model the behavior of sequential circuits, such as registers or flip-flops.

2. **Asynchronous Reset**: The use of an asynchronous reset requires the reset operation to occur immediately without waiting for the clock trigger. The non-blocking assignment ensures that signal updates are realized correctly with respect to clock edges and reset.

### Fix:
Change the assignment of `out1` to a non-blocking assignment. Additionally, ensure that both `data` and `out1` are updated with non-blocking assignments to correctly represent sequential logic and handle the asynchronous reset properly.

Here's the corrected part of the code:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
begin
    if (rst) begin
        data <= 1'b0;
        out1 <= 1'b0; // Ensure out1 is also reset
    end else begin
        data <= ~data;
        out1 <= data; // Use non-blocking assignment
    end
end
```

By making these changes, you'll ensure the synthesis tools correctly interpret the registers' reset behavior, resolving the error. The use of non-blocking assignments (`<=`) in sequential blocks with a reset condition is generally preferred to model the expected behavior of flip-flops with clear or preset capabilities.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
