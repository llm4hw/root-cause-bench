The error message indicates an issue with the asynchronous set/reset for the register `out1_reg` in module `top16`. This error is caused by the usage of both a synchronous reset in the sensitivity list (`posedge clk or posedge rst`) and an asynchronous reset in the always block for `out1`. 

To fix this error:
- Remove the posedge rst from the sensitivity list in the always block since it implies the asynchronous reset.
- Modify the always block to handle the synchronous reset separately, ensuring the reset logic is only tied to the specific registers and not combined with the regular clocked logic.

Here's an updated version of the always block:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk)
begin
    if (rst)
        data <= 1'b0;
    else
        data = ~data;
    out1 <= data;
end
```
By separating the synchronous clear logic (`rst`) from the clocked logic, this modification should resolve the error regarding the asynchronous set/reset extraction for the register `out1_reg` in module `top16`.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
