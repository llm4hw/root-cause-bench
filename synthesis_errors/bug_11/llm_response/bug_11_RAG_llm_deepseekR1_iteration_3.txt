### Bug Explanation
The error occurs because the `case` statement in the VHDL code does not cover all possible values of the input `sel`, which is a 2-bit `std_logic_vector`. The `case` statement only handles:
- `"00"`
- `"01"`
- `"10"`

The missing case is `"11"` (binary value `3`). Synthesis tools require **exhaustive coverage** of all possible input values in combinational logic (like this `case` statement) to avoid inferring unintended latches or registers. The error message explicitly states that the value `3` (represented as 32-bit `00000000000000000000000000000011`) is missing.

### Why This Causes an Error
1. **Incomplete Case Coverage**: 
   - A 2-bit signal has 4 possible values (`0` to `3`), but the `case` statement only covers 3 cases.
   - VHDL synthesis tools interpret incomplete `case` statements as implying "hold the previous value" for uncovered cases, which requires a latch (memory element). Latches are undesirable in most combinational logic.

2. **Synthesis Guardrails**: 
   - The tool (`[Synth 8-426]`) flags this as an error because:
     - It risks creating unstable or unintended hardware.
     - Modern synthesis tools enforce strict checks to prevent latch inference by default.

### Fix
Add a `when others` clause to cover all remaining cases (specifically `"11"`). This ensures:
- All 4 possible input values are covered.
- No latches are inferred.
- Output behavior is explicitly defined for `"11"`.

**Corrected Code:**
```vhdl
process(sel)
begin
    case sel is
        when "00" =>
            out1 <= '1';
        when "01" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        when "10" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        -- Add this to cover "11" and any other std_logic values (e.g., 'U','X')
        when others =>
            out1 <= '0'; -- Explicitly handle "11"
    end case;
end process;
```

### Key Points
- **`when others` is mandatory** for `std_logic`/`std_logic_vector` in combinational processes to cover all 9-value logic states (though synthesis focuses on `0`/`1`).
- Without this clause, synthesis fails because the tool cannot guarantee safe hardware implementation.
- The fix explicitly defines `out1 <= '0'` for `"11"`, matching the behavior of `"01"` and `"10"`.

> 🔍 **Note**: The error message's `32'b...` notation is the tool's internal representation of the value `3` (due to 32-bit integers), but the actual signal is 2 bits. Focus on the missing binary value (`11`), not the bit-width in the message.
