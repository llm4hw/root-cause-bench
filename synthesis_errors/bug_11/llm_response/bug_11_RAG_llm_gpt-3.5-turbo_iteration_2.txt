The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-426] missing choice(s) 32'b00000000000000000000000000000011 in case statement" is indicating that there is a missing case option in the `case` statement for the `sel` signal. The error is specifically pointing to missing choice(s) for the binary value `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`.

Looking at the Verilog code provided, the issue is that the `sel` signal is defined as a `std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)`, which means it can have values like "00", "01", "10", and "11". However, in the case statement, only cases for "00", "01", and "10" are defined, and the case for "11" is missing.

To fix this bug, you should add a case for "11" in the `case` statement. You can handle this case by assigning a value to `out1` for when `sel` is "11". Here is how you can update the case statement in your code:

```vhdl
case sel is
    when "00" =>
        out1 <= '1';
    when "01" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when "10" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when "11" =>  -- Add this case for "11"
        out1 <= '1';  -- Or assign whichever value is appropriate for "11"
end case;
```

By adding the missing case for "11", you should resolve the error message related to the missing choice in the case statement.
