### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because the `case` statement in your VHDL code does not cover all possible values of the `sel` input signal. Specifically:
1. `sel` is declared as a 2-bit vector (`std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)`)
2. The `case` statement only handles 3 of the 4 possible values: `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"10"`
3. The missing case `"11"` causes the synthesis error

### Why This Error Occurs
- **Synthesis Requirement**: VHDL requires all possible values of a signal to be covered in a `case` statement during synthesis. 
- **Missing Case**: The value `"11"` (binary 3) has no corresponding assignment
- **Tool Behavior**: The error message shows a 32-bit representation (`32'b000...11`) because synthesis tools internally expand signals, but the core issue is the missing 2-bit case `"11"`

### Fix
Add an `others` clause to handle all uncovered cases:

```vhdl
process(sel)
begin
    case sel is
        when "00" =>
            out1 <= '1';
        when "01" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        when "10" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        when others =>  -- Covers "11" and any invalid states
            out1 <= '0'; 
    end case;
end process;
```

### Key Changes:
1. Added `when others => out1 <= '0';` to handle:
   - The missing `"11"` case
   - Any metastable values (`'U'`, `'X'`, `'-'`)
2. Maintains original behavior: `'1'` only for `"00"`, `'0'` for all other inputs

### Why This Works:
- `others` clause satisfies synthesis completeness requirements
- Explicitly handles all 4 possible 2-bit combinations:
  - `00` → `1`
  - `01` → `0`
  - `10` → `0`
  - `11` → `0`
- Prevents inferred latches (which would occur if no default assignment existed)

> ⚠️ **Note**: This fix addresses both the synthesis error and potential simulation mismatches by ensuring full coverage of all input combinations.
