The error message is indicating that there is a missing choice in the case statement. Specifically, it's looking for the choice 32'b00000000000000000000000000000011 within the case statement.

In the provided Verilog code snippet, the case statement is using a sel signal of a std_logic_vector that is 2 bits wide. However, in the case statement, all the cases are being compared with 2-bit binary literals like "00", "01", and "10". The missing choice is the case when the sel signal is equal to "11" (32'b00000000000000000000000000000011).

To fix this issue, you need to add a case for when sel is "11". You can modify the case statement as follows:

```vhdl
case sel is
    when "00" =>
        out1 <= '1';
    when "01" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when "10" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when "11" =>
        -- add your desired behavior for "11"
end case;
```

By adding a case for "11", you will address the missing choice in the case statement and resolve the error.
