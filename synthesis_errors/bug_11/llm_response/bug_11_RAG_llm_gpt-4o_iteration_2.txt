The error message states that there is a missing choice in the case statement in your VHDL code: `missing choice(s) 32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`, which corresponds to the binary value of `11` for a `std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)` signal. 

The issue is occurring because the `case` statement in your code doesn't handle the case where `sel = "11"`. Since `sel` is a 2-bit vector, it can take on values corresponding to `00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`. Your current implementation only handles the first three (`00`, `01`, and `10`), and there is no `when others` clause to catch any unhandled values, including `11`.

To fix this issue, you can either explicitly include a `when "11"` clause in your case statement or use a `when others` clause to handle any unspecified cases. Here is how you might modify your code to include a `when others` statement:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top11 is

begin
    process(sel)
    begin
        case sel is
            when "00" =>
                out1 <= '1';
            when "01" =>
                out1 <= '0';
            when "10" =>
                out1 <= '0';
            when others =>
                out1 <= '0'; -- Default assignment for when sel is "11"
        end case;
    end process;

end Behavioral;
```

Adding `when others =>` ensures that all possible values of the `sel` input are handled, thus resolving the error.
