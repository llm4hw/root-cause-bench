The error message you provided indicates that the choice "32'b00000000000000000000000000000011" is missing in the case statement. However, looking at the VHDL code provided, it seems you are dealing with a 2-bit selector (`sel`), not a 32-bit vector.

Here is the root cause of the issue and the fix:

### Bug and Root Cause:
The error suggests that there is a missing case for a possible value of `sel`. In your VHDL code, `sel` is declared as a 2-bit vector (`std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)`). This means it can form four combinations: "00", "01", "10", and "11". However, your `case` statement only covers three of these combinations ("00", "01", "10"). The combination "11" is missing from the `case` statement, which is why the tool is generating an error that a case is missing.

### Solution:
To fix this error, you need to add a `when others` clause to handle any unexpected or unlisted combinations of `sel`, or you can specifically add a case for "11":

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top11 is

begin
    process(sel)
    begin
        case sel is
            when "00" =>
                out1 <= '1';
            when "01" =>
                out1 <= '0';
            when "10" =>
                out1 <= '0';
            when others =>
                out1 <= '0';  -- Define behavior for "11" or use 'others'
        end case;
    end process;

end Behavioral;
```

Using `when others` ensures that any possible value of `sel` that isn't explicitly listed will have a defined behavior, which helps avoid errors during synthesis or simulation when unexpected values are encountered.
