### Bug Explanation
The error occurs because the `case` statement in the VHDL process does not cover all possible values of the 2-bit input `sel`. Specifically, the value `"11"` (binary `3`) is missing from the case branches. This violates synthesis rules for combinational logic, as incomplete coverage infers a **latch** for `out1` when `sel = "11"`. Latches are undesirable in pure combinational logic because they:
1. Introduce unintended memory elements
2. Cause unstable simulation/synthesis results
3. Violate the design's combinational intent

### Why the Error Message Shows 32 Bits
The synthesis tool internally represents signals with 32-bit vectors for uniformity. The key part is the LSBs: `...00000011` indicates the missing value corresponds to binary `11` in the lower 2 bits.

### Fix
Add an `others` clause to cover all remaining cases (including `"11"`):

```vhdl
process(sel)
begin
    case sel is
        when "00" => out1 <= '1';
        when "01" => out1 <= '0';
        when "10" => out1 <= '0';
        when others => out1 <= '0'; -- Covers "11" and invalid states
    end case;
end process;
```

### Key Points
1. **Combinational Logic Requirement**: All input combinations must be explicitly handled
2. **`others` Clause**: Safely covers:
   - The missing `"11"` case
   - Any metastable values (e.g., `"UX"`, `"Z-"`) during simulation
3. **Latch Prevention**: Ensures `out1` is always driven, eliminating inferred latches

### Fixed Code
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top11 is
begin
    process(sel)
    begin
        case sel is
            when "00" => out1 <= '1';
            when "01" => out1 <= '0';
            when "10" => out1 <= '0';
            when others => out1 <= '0'; -- Critical fix
        end case;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

This change resolves the synthesis error while maintaining the original behavior: `out1 = '1'` only when `sel = "00"`, and `'0'` otherwise.
