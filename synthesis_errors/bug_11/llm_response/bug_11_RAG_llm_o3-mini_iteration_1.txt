The bug is that the case statement for the input sel does not include all possible values. In your VHDL code, sel is a 2‐bit std_logic_vector, which can have four possible values ("00", "01", "10", and "11"). Since you only provided choices for "00", "01", and "10", the input value "11" is not handled. This incompleteness causes the error (reported as missing choice for 32'b...11, corresponding to the "11" pattern).

The error occurs because, in VHDL, a case statement must cover every possible value of the selector signal, or provide an "others" clause to catch any values that aren’t explicitly listed. If the circuit or test bench drives sel to "11", the simulation will trigger an error because that case is not defined.

To fix the issue, you can either:

1. Add an explicit case for "11":  
   when "11" =>  
       out1 <= <desired_value>;  

OR

2. Use an others clause to cover any values that are not explicitly handled:  
   when others =>  
       out1 <= <desired_value>;  

This ensures that the case statement is complete, and the simulation or synthesis process will not complain about missing choices.
