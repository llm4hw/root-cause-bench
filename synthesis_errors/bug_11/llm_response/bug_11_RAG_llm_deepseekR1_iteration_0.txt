### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because the `case` statement in your VHDL code does not cover all possible values of the `sel` input signal. Specifically:
1. **`sel` is declared as `std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)`**, meaning it has 4 possible binary values: `"00"`, `"01"`, `"10"`, and `"11"`.
2. Your `case` statement only handles `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"10"`. The value `"11"` (equivalent to `32'b...00000011` in the error message) is missing.

### Why This Causes an Error
- VHDL requires all possible values of the `case` selector (`sel`) to be explicitly handled.
- Synthesis tools infer latches for unhandled cases (like `"11"` here), but modern tools like Vivado treat this as an error to prevent unintended latch inference and potential hardware issues.
- The error message explicitly flags the missing case (`32'b...00000011`), which corresponds to the binary `"11"` for your 2-bit signal.

### Fix
Add a `when others` clause to cover all unhandled cases (including `"11"`):

```vhdl
process(sel)
begin
    case sel is
        when "00" =>
            out1 <= '1';
        when "01" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        when "10" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        -- Add this to cover missing case "11" and other std_logic values
        when others =>
            out1 <= '0'; -- Handle '11', 'UX', etc.
    end case;
end process;
```

### Key Points
1. **`when others` is mandatory** for `std_logic_vector` signals since they can have non-binary values (like `'U'`, `'X'`), though synthesis typically treats them as don't-cares.
2. **No latches inferred**: The `when others` clause ensures `out1` is always assigned a value, preventing unintended latch inference.
3. **Synthesis compliance**: Complete coverage of all cases is required by synthesis tools (Vivado/Xilinx in this case).

> 🔍 **Note**: The 32-bit value in the error (`32'b0000...11`) is the tool's internal representation of your 2-bit `"11"` signal. The fix resolves this by covering all cases.
