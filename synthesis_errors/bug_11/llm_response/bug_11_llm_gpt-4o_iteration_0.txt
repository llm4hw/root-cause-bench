The error message you're seeing indicates that the case statement within the VHDL code is missing a choice for the value `"11"` when evaluating the `sel` input. This particular warning or error is generated during synthesis or simulation to alert you that not all possible combinations of input values are covered in the case statement, which can lead to undesirable behavior if an unhandled case occurs.

In VHDL, a `case` statement must handle all possible values of the case expression, which in this case is a 2-bit `std_logic_vector`. The valid values for `sel` range from `"00"` to `"11"`, representing 0 to 3 in decimal. The code provided only handles `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"10"`, leaving `"11"` unhandled. This unhandled case can cause issues in simulation and synthesis because the behavior when `sel` is `"11"` is not defined, which could potentially lead to simulation mismatches or synthesis errors.

To resolve this issue, ensure that all possible values for the `sel` input are accounted for in the `case` statement. A common method to handle all possible cases is to include a `when others` clause, which acts as a catch-all for any values not explicitly handled. This way, if `sel` takes on any value not covered by specific `when` conditions, the `when others` clause will define what action should be taken. However, since you're not fixing the bug but acknowledging the issue, it's enough to note that the missing case for `"11"` is causing this error.
