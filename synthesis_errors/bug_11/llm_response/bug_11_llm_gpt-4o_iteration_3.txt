The error message indicates that there is a missing choice in your `case` statement. Specifically, the compiler is indicating that it does not know how to handle the case when `sel` is `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`. However, looking at your code, `sel` is declared as a `std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)`, which means it should only hold 2-bit values. The possible values for `sel` should range from "00" to "11" (0 to 3 in binary), corresponding to two bits.

Currently, you have covered three of the four possible cases in your `case` statement: "00", "01", and "10". You are missing the "11" case. So, if `sel` is ever "11", the `case` statement will not have a matching `when` branch to execute, and thus the synthesis tool is warning you about a missing choice for this condition.

To fix this issue, you need to add a handling for the "11" case within your `case` statement. Alternatively, if there is a default behavior you want to apply when none of the explicit cases match, you could add a `when others =>` clause to cover any cases that you haven't explicitly defined. This will ensure that the process has a defined behavior for every possible value of `sel`.
