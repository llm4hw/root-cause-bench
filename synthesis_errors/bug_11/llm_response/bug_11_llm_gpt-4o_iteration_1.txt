The error message you are encountering indicates that there is a missing choice in the case statement for the given `sel` input vector. The case statement is being used to decide the value of `out1` based on the value of `sel`. However, the error message specifically mentions a missing choice for `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`.

Here are the essential points leading to this error:

1. **Understanding `sel`:** The `sel` input signal is declared as a 2-bit vector (`std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)`), which means it can only take on values represented by 2 bits: `00`, `01`, `10`, or `11`.

2. **Case Statement Coverage:** Your case statement currently handles three of the four possible combinations (`00`, `01`, `10`) but does not handle the case where `sel` is `11`.

3. **Error Generation:** During simulation, if `sel` is ever set to `11`, the case statement does not account for this input, resulting in unspecified behavior. The error message you're seeing suggests that at some point during your test bench execution, `sel` becomes `11` and the case statement lacks a corresponding handler.

4. **Fix Explanation:** To address this issue, you need to add a `when` branch for the missing `11` value to ensure complete coverage of potential values `sel` can take. Ideally, this would involve adding the following: `when "11" =>` followed by whatever output logic you desire for this particular input.

By completing the case statement in your process to handle all possible inputs, you ensure that the design behaves deterministically for any possible input values and avoid errors related to incomplete case coverage.
