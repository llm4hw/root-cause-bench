The error message indicates that a specific choice in the `case` statement is missing. The `case` statement is used to select one of several blocks of code to be executed based on the value of a given expression, in this case, the `sel` signal. The error specifically references `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`, which translates to a binary value of `3` (or "11" in 2-bit binary).

The warning occurs because, in the `case` statement, you have only provided mappings for when `sel` is "00", "01", and "10". However, `sel` is a 2-bit signal, meaning it can potentially take on four different values: "00", "01", "10", and "11". You did not provide a mapping for when `sel` is "11", and this is what the error message is pointing out.

The absence of a `when "11" =>` clause in the `case` statement leads to an incomplete specification of the possible states that `sel` can represent. This can cause simulation issues if the test bench or any operational condition generates `sel` as "11", leading to undefined behavior for the output signal `out1`.

To address this issue, you should ensure that all possible values of the `sel` signal are covered by adding an appropriate `when "11" =>` clause in the `case` statement. Alternatively, you can use a `when others =>` statement to catch any unspecified values, which will prevent such errors and ensure defined behavior for all possible values of `sel`.
