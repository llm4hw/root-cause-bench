The error message indicates that there is a missing choice in the `case` statement for the value `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`. However, looking at your code and the definition of `sel`, which is a 2-bit vector, it's clear that the maximum binary value `sel` can hold is `2'b11`, not `32'b...11`. 

Here is the root cause and the fix:

**Root Cause:**
1. The error message is misleading due to a discrepancy between the simulation environment or the test bench inputs and the defined width of the `sel` input in your design. The test bench might be trying to stimulate the design with values that are out of bounds for the declared width of `sel` (2 bits).

2. The `case` statement doesn't handle the `sel` value of `"11"` (`2'b11`), which would be a valid 2-bit binary input value. This is causing synthesis or simulation errors, as the synthesizer expects all possible input combinations to be covered.

**Fix:**
1. Update your `case` statement to include a handling for the `when "11"` condition. This will ensure that all possible values for the 2-bit `sel` signal are covered. For example:

```vhdl
process(sel)
begin
    case sel is
        when "00" =>
            out1 <= '1';
        when "01" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        when "10" =>
            out1 <= '0';
        when "11" => 
            out1 <= '1'; -- or whatever logic you need for this condition
        when others =>
            out1 <= '0'; -- Optional, but good practice to handle unexpected cases
    end case;
end process;
```

2. Ensure that the test bench does not pass any stimulus value to `sel` that exceeds the two bits defined in its declaration.

By covering all 2-bit combinations in your design, you can prevent the error you are experiencing during simulation. Additionally, using a `when others` statement is good practice to handle unexpected or default cases gracefully.
