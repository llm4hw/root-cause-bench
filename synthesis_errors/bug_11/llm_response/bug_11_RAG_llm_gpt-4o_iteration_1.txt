The error message you're encountering indicates that there is a missing case choice for a specific value, `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`, in your case statement. However, based on your provided code, `sel` is declared as a 2-bit wide `std_logic_vector`. This suggests that the issue may not be with the original code you've provided but rather with the testbench or the test itself.

Here's a breakdown of the situation:

1. **Error Explanation**: The error message specifies that there is a missing choice for `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011`, which is a 2-bit vector interpreted as a 32-bit value. This does not match the range of values defined by a 2-bit vector (`"00"`, `"01"`, `"10"`, or `"11"`), which indicates a misalignment between the testbench and the component under test.

2. **Cause**: This error might be due to a mismatch between the width of `sel` in your testbench and the width expected by your module. If the testbench is incorrectly driving a 32-bit value into a 2-bit port, this could be the cause.

3. **Fix**: Ensure that the testbench matches the expected input size of `sel`. All testbench inputs or any other driving mechanisms for the `sel` port should be constrained to 2 bits only. Verify that every potential value for a 2-bit wide selection (`"00"`, `"01"`, `"10"`, `"11"`) is covered, while attempting to drive a 32-bit wide vector should be modified to only drive valid 2-bit vectors.

4. **Code Update**: If `"11"` is indeed a valid input, you should also add this to your case statement:

```vhdl
    process(sel)
    begin
        case sel is
            when "00" =>
                out1 <= '1';
            when "01" =>
                out1 <= '0';
            when "10" =>
                out1 <= '0';
            when "11" =>  -- Added to cover all possible 2-bit combinations
                out1 <= '1'; -- or any appropriate behavior
        end case;
    end process;
```

Ensure that your testbench is correctly specifying `sel` values that are just 2-bit wide. Once you make these adjustments, the error should be resolved. If the error persists, review your testbench for any logic that might be misinterpreting or mishandling the `sel` port.
