The bug in the provided code is due to the fact that the case statement in the process does not cover all possible values of the input signal `sel`. The error message specifically indicates that the value `32'b00000000000000000000000000000011` is missing in the case statement.

To fix this bug, all possible values of the input signal `sel` need to be covered in the case statement. In this case, since the `sel` signal is a two-bit vector, it can take on four possible combinations (binary `00`, `01`, `10`, `11`). Therefore, each of these combinations should be considered in the case statement to ensure that all possible cases are handled.
