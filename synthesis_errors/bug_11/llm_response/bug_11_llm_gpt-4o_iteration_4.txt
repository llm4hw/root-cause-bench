The error message you've encountered is related to an incomplete case statement. Let's break down what's happening:

1. **Case Statement Overview**: In VHDL, when using a `case` statement, you are required to cover all possible input cases or include a "when others" clause to handle unspecified cases. This is necessary to ensure that the behavior is defined for every possible input of the case selectorâ€”in this case, `sel`.

2. **Selector Size**: The `sel` signal is a `std_logic_vector` with a size of 2 bits (`sel : in std_logic_vector(1 downto 0);`). This means it can represent four possible binary values: "00", "01", "10", and "11".

3. **Missing Case**: Your current `case` statement only includes specific actions for the values "00", "01", and "10". You have not specified what should happen when `sel` is "11". Thus, the synthesis tool or simulator is flagging this as an error because the behavior of the code is undefined for one of the possible values of `sel`.

4. **Resulting Behavior**: Since you have not accounted for the "11" scenario in your `case` statement, this can lead to unpredictable behavior during simulation or synthesis. The tool requires that every possible input have a corresponding defined output or behavior to ensure robust and reliable design.

5. **Fix Explanation**: To fix this issue, you need to ensure that all potential values of `sel` are covered in the `case` statement. This can be done by explicitly including a line for the "11" case, or more generally, by including a "when others" clause to cover any unhandled cases. This will resolve the error by defining a default behavior for any unspecified cases, ensuring the completeness of the case statement, and aligning with VHDL's requirement for exhaustive case analysis.

Conclusively, to address the issue, you need to update the `case` statement to handle the missing choice to meet VHDL's completeness requirement.
