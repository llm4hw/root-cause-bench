The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-426] missing choice(s) 32'b00000000000000000000000000000011 in case statement" indicates that there is a missing choice in the case statement that corresponds to the input value 32'b00000000000000000000000000000011, which is not handled in the code. 

In the provided Verilog code snippet, the case statement is written for a 2-bit input `sel`, but the error message suggests that there is an input value larger than expected (32 bits) that is not covered in the case statement.

To fix this bug, you should update the case statement in the code to cover all possible input values within the expected range. Since the input `sel` is defined as a 2-bit vector, the case statement should be modified to handle 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11) instead of 32-bit values. 

Here is the corrected case statement for the Verilog code:

```verilog
case sel is
    when "00" =>
        out1 <= '1';
    when "01" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when "10" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when others =>
        out1 <= '0';  -- Handle any other input values not explicitly mentioned
end case;
```

By adding the "when others" clause, you ensure that any unhandled input value will default to a specified behavior, which will prevent the error message related to missing choices during the simulation.
