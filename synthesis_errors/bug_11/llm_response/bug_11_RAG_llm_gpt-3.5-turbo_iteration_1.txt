The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-426] missing choice(s) 32'b00000000000000000000000000000011 in case statement" is indicating that a particular case option is missing in the encoding that the synthesizer is expecting.

In your Verilog code snippet, the `sel` is declared as a `std_logic_vector(1 downto 0);` which means it can take "00", "01", "10", or "11" as values. However, in your case statement, you only have cases for "00", "01", and "10", missing the scenario where `sel` is "11".

To fix this issue, you should add a case for when `sel` is "11" in your case statement like this:

```vhdl
case sel is
    when "00" =>
        out1 <= '1';
    when "01" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when "10" =>
        out1 <= '0';
    when "11" =>
        -- Add appropriate assignment here
end case;
```

By adding the missing case for "11" in your case statement, you can address the error message and ensure that all possible values of `sel` are covered in the code.
