The bug occurs because the signal `data` is declared as a `wire` but is being assigned inside a procedural `always` block. In Verilog:

1. **Procedural assignments** (inside `always`/`initial`) require **variable types** (`reg`, `integer`, etc.)
2. **Wire types** can only be driven by **continuous assignments** (`assign` statements)

Here's the problematic code:
```verilog
wire data; // ❌ Incorrect type for procedural assignment

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) 
begin
    if (rst)
        data <= 1'b0; // 🚫 Procedural assignment to wire
    else
        data <= ~data;
end
```

**Fix**: Change `data` from `wire` to `reg`:
```verilog
reg data; // ✅ Correct type for procedural assignment
```

Fixed module:
```verilog
module top15(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);
    reg data; // Changed to reg

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            data <= 1'b0; 
        else
            data <= ~data;
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
```

**Why this works**:
- `reg` types can store values between procedural assignments
- Flip-flops in hardware require register-type storage
- Synthesis tools map `reg` to actual storage elements (flip-flops/latches)

**Additional note**: The `out1` assignment will work correctly since it's already declared as `output reg`. The value of `out1` will be the previous value of `data` (one clock cycle delayed), which is standard behavior for sequential logic. If you want `out1` to update immediately with the new `data` value, move the assignment before the `data` assignments.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: generation. If you don’t assign every element that can be assigned inside an always@( * ) block
every time that always@( * ) block is executed, a latch (similar to a register but much harder to
work with in FPGAs) will be inferred for that element. This is never what you want and is a
terrible place for bugs. As this is subtle, it is somewhat hard to visualize. Consider Program 17.

Verilog uses procedural assignment to model signal assignments that are based on an event. An
event is most commonly a transition of a signal. This provides the ability to model sequential logic circuits
such as D-ﬂip-ﬂops and ﬁnite state machines by triggering assignments off of a clock edge. Procedural
assignments can only drive variable data types (i.e., reg, integer, real, and time); thus, they are ideal for...
