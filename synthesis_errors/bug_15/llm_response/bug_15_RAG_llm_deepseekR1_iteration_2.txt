The bug occurs because a procedural assignment is being used on a `wire` type signal (`data`), which is not permitted in Verilog. Procedural assignments (inside `always` blocks) can only be applied to variable types like `reg`, not net types like `wire`.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. In the code, `data` is declared as `wire data;`
2. The `always` block contains procedural assignments to `data`:
   ```verilog
   data <= 1'b0; // Reset assignment
   data <= ~data; // Normal operation
   ```
3. Procedural assignments (`<=` or `=`) can only target `reg` types, not `wire` types
4. This violates Verilog synthesis rules, causing the "[Synth 8-2576] procedural assignment to a non-register" error

**Fix:**
1. Change the declaration of `data` from `wire` to `reg`
2. Additionally, fix the reset behavior for `out1` to avoid undefined values during reset by explicitly assigning it in the reset branch

**Corrected Code:**
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top15(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);
    reg data;  // Changed from wire to reg

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst) begin
            data <= 1'b0;  // Initialize data
            out1 <= 1'b0;  // Initialize out1 (added to prevent undefined value)
        end else begin
            data <= ~data; // Toggle data
            out1 <= data;  // Assign current data value to out1
        end
    end
endmodule
```

**Explanation of Fix:**
1. Changing `data` to `reg` allows it to be legally assigned in procedural blocks
2. The added `out1 <= 1'b0` in the reset branch ensures:
   - Both signals are properly initialized during reset
   - Prevents `out1` from getting an undefined value (since it would otherwise get the pre-reset value of `data` during the reset cycle)
3. Maintains the original behavior where:
   - `out1` follows the previous value of `data`
   - `data` toggles its value each clock cycle
   - Both signals reset synchronously to 0

**Additional Improvement Option:**
If you want `out1` to always match the current value of `data` (rather than the previous value), you could implement:
```verilog
// Alternative implementation with continuous assignment
module top15(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output wire out1  // Now a wire
);
    reg data;

    assign out1 = data;  // Continuous assignment

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst) data <= 1'b0;
        else data <= ~data;
    end
endmodule
```

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

Verilog uses procedural assignment to model signal assignments that are based on an event. An
event is most commonly a transition of a signal. This provides the ability to model sequential logic circuits
such as D-ﬂip-ﬂops and ﬁnite state machines by triggering assignments off of a clock edge. Procedural
assignments can only drive variable data types (i.e., reg, integer, real, and time); thus, they are ideal for...
