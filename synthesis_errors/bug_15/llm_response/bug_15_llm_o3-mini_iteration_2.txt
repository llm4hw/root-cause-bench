The error message indicates that there's a procedural assignment (using "<=" inside an always block) being made to a signal declared as a wire. In Verilog, only variables declared as a register (reg) can be assigned values in procedural blocks. In your code, the signal "data" is declared as a wire, but you are using it in an always block with blocking assignments. This mismatch causes the synthesis error.

The issue is occurring because the design tools expect signals assigned within always blocks to be declared with a type that supports storage elements and procedural assignments (typically reg). When a wire is used in this context, it violates the Verilog semantics and leads to the reported error.

To fix the bug, the signal "data" should be declared as a reg rather than as a wire. This ensures that the tool recognizes it as a storage element that can be assigned values procedurally.
