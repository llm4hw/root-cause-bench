The error occurs because inside the always block you are making a procedural (non-blocking) assignment to a signal that is declared as a wire. In Verilog, signals that are the target of procedural assignments must be declared as registers (or a similar type that supports these assignments, such as logic in SystemVerilog). Since “data” is declared as a wire, attempting to assign to it with the non-blocking assignment operator (<=) triggers the synthesis tool error.

The underlying issue is that wires are intended for continuous assignments and connections between modules, not for sequences of operations inside procedural blocks. To resolve the error, you need to change the declaration of “data” so that it is capable of holding its state and being updated within the clocked process—that is, declare it as a register rather than a wire.
