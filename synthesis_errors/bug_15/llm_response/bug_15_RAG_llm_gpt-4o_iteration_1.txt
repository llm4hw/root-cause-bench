The error you're encountering, "procedural assignment to a non-register data is not permitted," is due to attempting to assign a value to a `wire` type variable (`data` in this instance) using procedural assignment within an `always` block. In Verilog, procedural assignments can only be made to variables of type `reg`, `integer`, `real`, and `time`. 

The key point here is that `data` is currently declared as a `wire`, which means it cannot be used as the target of a procedural assignment (`<=` or `=`) within an `always` block. 

### Solution

To fix the issue, change `data` from a `wire` to a `reg`. This will permit the procedural assignments within the `always` block:

```verilog
module top15(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);
    reg data; // Change 'wire' to 'reg'

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            data <= 1'b0; // Initialize data on reset
        else
            data <= ~data;
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation
- Changing `data` to a `reg` type allows it to be assigned within the procedural `always` block using blocking (`=`) or non-blocking (`<=`) assignments. This fits with its intended use, as `data` appears to be intended to store a value that can change over time in response to clock edges.
- With this change, the synthesis tool should no longer flag any errors related to procedural assignments to `data`.

Remember that in Verilog, "reg" does not imply a physical register; it's simply how you declare a variable which can retain a value between procedural assignments in simulation.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

every time that always@( * ) block is executed, a latch (similar to a register but much harder to

terrible place for bugs. As this is subtle, it is somewhat hard to visualize. Consider Program 17.

Verilog uses procedural assignment to model signal assignments that are based on an event. An
event is most commonly a transition of a signal. This provides the ability to model sequential logic circuits
such as D-ﬂip-ﬂops and ﬁnite state machines by triggering assignments off of a clock edge. Procedural
assignments can only drive variable data types (i.e., reg, integer, real, and time); thus, they are ideal for...
