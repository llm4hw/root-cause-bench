The bug in the provided Verilog code is due to the fact that the 'data' signal is declared as a wire and later assigned values inside an always block. In Verilog, a wire type signal can't be assigned a value in a procedural block like an always block. Wires can only be assigned continuous assignments, not procedural assignments.

To fix this bug, you should change the declaration of 'data' from wire to reg. Since 'data' is being assigned values in the always block, it needs to be declared as a reg type signal. This will allow you to assign values to 'data' within the always block without triggering the synthesis error.
