The bug is that the signal "data" is declared as a wire but is being assigned inside an always block using a procedural (nonblocking) assignment. In Verilog, procedural assignments (using “<=” or “=” inside an always block) can only be made to variables of type reg (or similar variable types), not to wires.

Why is it occurring?
• The error message is generated because you're trying to assign a value to a wire through a procedural assignment.
• In Verilog, a wire is intended for continuous assignments (using the assign statement) or for module port connections. When you attempt to drive a wire inside an always block, synthesis and simulation tools flag it as an error.

How to fix it:
• Change the declaration of the "data" signal from a wire to a reg so that it can be procedurally assigned.
• Modify the code by replacing “wire data;” with “reg data;” in your module.

module top15(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);
    // Declare data as reg to allow procedural assignment:
    reg data;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            data <= 1'b0; // Initialize data on reset
        else
            data <= ~data;
        out1 <= data;
    end

endmodule
------------------------------------------------

By making "data" a reg, the always block can update its value and the simulation error will be resolved.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

every time that always@( * ) block is executed, a latch (similar to a register but much harder to
work with in FPGAs) will be inferred for that element. This is never what you want and is a
terrible place for bugs. As this is subtle, it is somewhat hard to visualize. Consider Program 17.

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: 5.1 Procedural Assignment
Verilog uses procedural assignment to model signal assignments that are based on an event. An
event is most commonly a transition of a signal. This provides the ability to model sequential logic circuits
such as D-ﬂip-ﬂops and ﬁnite state machines by triggering assignments off of a clock edge. Procedural
assignments can only drive variable data types (i.e., reg, integer, real, and time); thus, they are ideal for...
