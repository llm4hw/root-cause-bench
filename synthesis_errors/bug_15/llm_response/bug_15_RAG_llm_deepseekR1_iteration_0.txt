### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because you are attempting to use a **procedural assignment** (non-blocking assignment `<=`) on a signal declared as `wire` (`wire data;`). In Verilog:

1. **`wire` types** can only be driven by:
   - Continuous assignments (`assign` statements)
   - Module ports
   - Connections between modules

2. **Procedural blocks** (`always`/`initial`) can **only** assign to **`reg` types** (or other variable types like `integer`, but not `wire`).

The line `data <= 1'b0;` inside the `always` block violates this rule because `data` is a `wire`.

### Fix:
Change the declaration of `data` from `wire` to `reg`:

```verilog
module top15(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);
    reg data;  // Changed from wire to reg

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            data <= 1'b0; // Now valid: procedural assignment to reg
        else
            data <= ~data;
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
```

### Why This Works:
- `reg` signals can be assigned procedurally (in `always`/`initial` blocks).
- The `always` block describes sequential logic (flip-flops triggered by clock/reset edges), which requires `reg` for its outputs.

### Additional Notes:
1. **Reset Behavior**: The current code assigns `out1 <= data` **after** updating `data`. This means:
   - `out1` will be the **previous value** of `data` (not the newly updated value).
   - If you want `out1` to reflect the new `data` value immediately, move `out1 <= data;` inside the `if-else` branches.

2. **Initial X-state**: On power-up (before reset), `data` and `out1` will be `X` (unknown). To avoid this, explicitly initialize them in the reset clause:
   ```verilog
   always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
       if (rst) begin
           data <= 1'b0;
           out1 <= 1'b0; // Reset out1 too
       end
       else begin
           data <= ~data;
           out1 <= data; // Or: out1 <= ~data; for same-cycle update
       end
   end
   ```

### Summary:
- **Root Cause**: Procedural assignment to a `wire`.
- **Fix**: Declare `data` as `reg`.
- **Best Practice**: Use `reg` for signals assigned in procedural blocks modeling sequential logic.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

Verilog uses procedural assignment to model signal assignments that are based on an event. An
event is most commonly a transition of a signal. This provides the ability to model sequential logic circuits
such as D-ﬂip-ﬂops and ﬁnite state machines by triggering assignments off of a clock edge. Procedural
assignments can only drive variable data types (i.e., reg, integer, real, and time); thus, they are ideal for...
