The bug in the code is due to the assignment of `data` inside the `always` block using `<=`, which infers a latch in hardware, but `data` is declared as a `wire`, not a `reg`. This results in the error message: "procedural assignment to a non-register data is not permitted."

To fix this bug, you should change the declaration of `data` from `wire` to `reg`. This change will allow proper procedural assignment inside the `always` block without inferring a latch. Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module top15(
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg out1
);
    reg data; // Change data declaration to reg

    always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
            data <= 1'b0; // Initialize data on reset
        else
            data <= ~data;
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
```

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: generation. If you don’t assign every element that can be assigned inside an always@( * ) block
every time that always@( * ) block is executed, a latch (similar to a register but much harder to
work with in FPGAs) will be inferred for that element. This is never what you want and is a
terrible place for bugs. As this is subtle, it is somewhat hard to visualize. Consider Program 17.

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: 5.1 Procedural Assignment
Verilog uses procedural assignment to model signal assignments that are based on an event. An
event is most commonly a transition of a signal. This provides the ability to model sequential logic circuits
such as D-ﬂip-ﬂops and ﬁnite state machines by triggering assignments off of a clock edge. Procedural
assignments can only drive variable data types (i.e., reg, integer, real, and time); thus, they are ideal for...
