The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-2715] syntax error near elsif" indicates a syntax error in the Verilog code. In the provided code snippet, the issue is with the missing "then" keyword after `(others => '0')`. The correct syntax should be:

```vhdl
data_out <= (others => '0');
```

Adding the missing semicolon at the end of this line will resolve the syntax error. After fixing that issue, the code should be able to run without errors during simulation.

catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).
