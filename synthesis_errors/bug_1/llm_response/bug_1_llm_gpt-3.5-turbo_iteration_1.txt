The bug in the provided code is a syntax error in the if-elsif conditional block within the process statement of architecture Behavioral in the file top1.vhd. The issue is that there is a missing semicolon at the end of the line where data_out <= (others => '0') assignment is made. The error specifically points to the line where the elsif rising_edge(clk) then statement is located.

To fix this issue, you need to add a semicolon at the end of the data_out <= (others => '0') statement within the if rst = '1' then block. The corrected line should be: data_out <= (others => '0');

After making this correction, the syntax error should be resolved, and the code should simulate without any issues.

It's important to note that missing semicolons at the end of statements in HDL code can often lead to syntax errors, so always ensure that each statement is properly terminated with a semicolon.
