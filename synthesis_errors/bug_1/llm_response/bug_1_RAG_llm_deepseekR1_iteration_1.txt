Based on the provided context and error message, here's the analysis and solution:

**The Bug**: Missing semicolon (`;`) after the reset assignment statement.  
**Error Line**: `data_out <= (others => '0')` (line before the elsif)  
**Why It Occurs**:  
1. In VHDL, all assignment statements **must end with a semicolon** (`;`).  
2. The missing semicolon after `(others => '0')` causes the parser to treat the following `elsif` as part of the same incomplete statement.  
3. This violates VHDL syntax rules, triggering the syntax error at `elsif`.

**Fix**: Add the missing semicolon:  
```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');  -- Added semicolon here
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

**Explanation**:  
- VHDL requires explicit statement terminators (unlike Verilog where `end` keywords often imply termination).  
- The parser expects either another statement or `end if` after the reset assignment, but finds `elsif` instead, causing confusion.  
- This is a common syntax error when transitioning from Verilog to VHDL (Verilog doesn't require semicolons after block-terminating statements like `end`).

**Corrected Code**:  
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top1 is
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            data_out <= (others => '0');  -- FIXED: Added semicolon
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            data_out <= data_in;
        end if;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```
