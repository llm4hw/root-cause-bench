The error message: ERROR: [Synth 8-2715] syntax error near elsif [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_1/rtl/top1.vhd:47] indicates that there is a syntax error in the Verilog code at line 47, particularly with the use of "elsif" instead of the correct "else if" in the code snippet provided. 

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to replace "elsif" with "else if" in the process block. Here's the corrected snippet:

```vhdl
process (clk, rst)
begin
    if rst = '1' then
        data_out <= (others => '0');
    else if rising_edge(clk) then
        data_out <= data_in;
    end if;
end process;
```

By making this correction and using "else if" instead of "elsif", the syntax error should be resolved, and the code should function correctly during simulation without generating the error message.
