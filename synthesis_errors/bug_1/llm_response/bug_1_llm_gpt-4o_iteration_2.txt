The error message you are encountering indicates there is a syntax issue in your VHDL code regarding the use of the `elsif` keyword. Specifically, the error points to the line where you are trying to check the rising edge of the clock signal.

In VHDL, the correct conditional structure for handling synchronous reset and clock events is to use an `if` statement to check if the reset condition is met, and then use another `if` statement (not `elsif`) in the case where reset is not active to check for the rising edge of the clock. The crucial point is that for checking a clock edge, you must use `if rising_edge(clk)` instead of `elsif rising_edge(clk)`. The `elsif` keyword is generally used to add additional conditions after an existing `if` or another `elsif` condition, and is not appropriate for the clock edge condition.

Here's a breakdown of why this is problematic:
- `elsif` is intended to extend the primary conditional `if` with additional conditions and is used when chaining multiple conditional checks that are not mutually exclusive.
- The `rising_edge(clk)` condition is not a logical extension or alternative of the `if rst = '1'` condition, but rather a separate condition that is evaluated when reset is not active.
- By using `elsif` in this context, the logic of checking for a rising edge is improperly sequenced as part of the reset condition chain, leading to the syntax error you observed.

To fix this issue, you'll need to replace the `elsif` with an `if` statement for the rising edge condition. Doing so will separate reset logic from clocked logic properly inside your process block.
