Based on the error message and code analysis, here's the bug explanation and solution:

**The Bug:**  
There's a **missing semicolon (`;`)** at the end of the reset assignment line:  
```vhdl
data_out <= (others => '0')  -- Missing semicolon here
```

**Why It's Occurring:**  
1. VHDL requires **every statement to end with a semicolon** (`;`)  
2. The missing semicolon after `(others => '0')` causes the parser to treat the `elsif` as part of the same incomplete statement  
3. This violates VHDL syntax rules since `elsif` must start a new conditional branch  

**The Fix:**  
Add the missing semicolon to the reset assignment line:  
```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');  -- Added semicolon here
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
```

**Corrected Code Section:**  
```vhdl
process (clk, rst)
begin
    if rst = '1' then
        data_out <= (others => '0');  -- Fixed line
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
        data_out <= data_in;
    end if;
end process;
```

**Why This Resolves the Error:**  
1. The semicolon properly terminates the reset assignment statement  
2. The parser can now correctly interpret `elsif` as the start of a new conditional branch  
3. VHDL syntax rules for process blocks are satisfied  

**Additional Note:**  
The sensitivity list `(clk, rst)` is correct for this asynchronous reset design. The `rising_edge(clk)` check ensures synchronous operation when reset isn't active. No other changes are needed in the architecture.
