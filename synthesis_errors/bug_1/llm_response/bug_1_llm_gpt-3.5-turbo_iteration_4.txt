The bug in the provided VHDL code is that there is a missing "then" keyword after the condition "if rst = '1'". The VHDL syntax requires the "then" keyword to be present after the condition in an if-else statement. In this case, the missing "then" keyword is causing a syntax error when the code is being synthesized.

To fix this issue, you need to add the "then" keyword after the condition "if rst = '1'" in the process block. This will correctly separate the condition from the code block to be executed when the condition is met.

After adding the missing "then" keyword, the code should be syntactically correct and should not generate the syntax error near "elsif rising_edge(clk)" during synthesis.

Remember to check the overall logic and functionality of the code after fixing the syntax error to ensure that it behaves as expected.
