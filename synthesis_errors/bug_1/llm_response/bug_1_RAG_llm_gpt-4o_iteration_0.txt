The error message you're seeing, "ERROR: [Synth 8-2715] syntax error near elsif," indicates that there is a syntax issue in your VHDL code. The problem arises because there is a missing semicolon at the end of the line where the `data_out` signal is assigned in the reset condition. 

Here's the problematic line in your code:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0')  -- Missing semicolon here
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

To fix the error, you should add a semicolon at the end of the line where `data_out` is assigned during the reset condition, like this:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');  -- Corrected with semicolon
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

VHDL requires a semicolon to terminate each sequential statement. The absence of a semicolon before the `elsif` keyword caused the syntax error. Adding the missing semicolon will resolve this issue, allowing your code to be correctly synthesized and simulated.
