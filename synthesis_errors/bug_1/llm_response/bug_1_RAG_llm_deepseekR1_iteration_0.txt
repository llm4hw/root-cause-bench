Based on the error message and code analysis, the bug is a **missing semicolon** in the reset branch of your VHDL process. Here's the breakdown:

### 🐛 Root Cause
In the reset condition:
```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0')   -- MISSING SEMICOLON HERE
```
The assignment to `data_out` is missing a terminating semicolon (`;`). This causes the VHDL parser to interpret the `elsif` as part of the incomplete assignment statement, resulting in a syntax error.

### 🔧 Fix
Add a semicolon at the end of the reset assignment:
```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');  -- SEMICOLON ADDED HERE
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
```

### 📖 Explanation
1. **VHDL Syntax Rule**: Every signal assignment inside a process **must end with a semicolon**.
2. **Parser Behavior**: Without the semicolon, the parser expects the assignment to continue onto the next line. When it encounters `elsif` (which isn't valid in an assignment), it throws the syntax error.
3. **Error Location**: The error points to `elsif` because that's where the parser realizes the syntax is broken.

### ✅ Corrected Code Section
```vhdl
process (clk, rst)
begin
    if rst = '1' then
        data_out <= (others => '0');  -- Fixed with semicolon
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
        data_out <= data_in;
    end if;
end process;
```

### 💡 Pro Tip
Always double-check statement terminators in VHDL. This error is especially common when transitioning from Verilog (where assignments in blocks don't require semicolons) to VHDL.
