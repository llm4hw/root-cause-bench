The error message indicates that the simulator encountered a syntax problem at the line with "elsif rising_edge(clk) then". In VHDL, each statement inside a process must end with a semicolon, and the keyword "elsif" needs to directly follow a properly terminated "if" branch. In this case, the assignment in the reset branch (data_out <= (others => '0')) is missing its semicolon. Without the semicolon, the compiler misunderstands where the first statement ends and therefore flags the following "elsif" as a syntax error. 

This problem is occurring because the VHDL language requires explicit statement termination, and the missing semicolon leads to an incorrect parsing of the process code. The fix is to add the missing semicolon at the end of the assignment in the reset branch so that the "elsif" correctly begins the next conditional branch.
