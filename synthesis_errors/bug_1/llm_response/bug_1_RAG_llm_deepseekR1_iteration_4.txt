Based on the error message and code analysis, the bug is a **missing semicolon** in the reset clause. Here's the breakdown:

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Error Location**:
   ```vhdl
   if rst = '1' then
       data_out <= (others => '0')   <-- MISSING SEMICOLON
   elsif rising_edge(clk) then
   ```
   - The assignment `data_out <= (others => '0')` lacks a terminating semicolon (`;`)
   - This causes the parser to treat the `elsif` as part of the previous incomplete statement

2. **Why VHDL Requires Semicolons**:
   - VHDL uses semicolons as statement terminators (unlike Python/Matlab)
   - All signal assignments must end with `;`
   - Missing semicolons break the parser's expectation of statement boundaries

3. **Compiler Perspective**:
   The parser sees this as:
   ```vhdl
   data_out <= (others => '0') elsif rising_edge(clk) then...
   ```
   This is invalid syntax since `elsif` is being treated as part of the assignment.

### Fix:
Add a semicolon to the reset assignment:
```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');  -- FIXED SEMICOLON HERE
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

### Corrected Full Code:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top1 is
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            data_out <= (others => '0');  -- SEMICOLON ADDED
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            data_out <= data_in;
        end if;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

### Why This Matters:
- VHDL is strictly syntax-sensitive
- Missing terminators cause cascading errors by confusing the parser
- The error appears at `elsif` because that's where the syntax becomes irrecoverably invalid

This fix resolves the syntax error while maintaining the intended functionality:
1. Synchronous reset clears `data_out`
2. Normal operation passes `data_in` to `data_out` on clock edges
