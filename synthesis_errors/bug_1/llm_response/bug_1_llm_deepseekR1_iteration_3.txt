The bug is a **missing semicolon (`;`)** at the end of the assignment in the `if` branch. Here's why this causes the error:

1. **Syntax Violation**:  
   VHDL requires every statement to end with a semicolon. The line:  
   ```data_out <= (others => '0')```  
   lacks a terminating semicolon, making it syntactically incomplete.

2. **Parser Confusion**:  
   The VHDL parser expects a semicolon after the assignment in the `if` branch. When it encounters `elsif` immediately after the unterminated statement, it fails to recognize `elsif` as a valid keyword in this context.  

3. **Error Location**:  
   The error points to `elsif` (line 47) because the parser only detects the problem when it reaches this keyword, but the root cause is the missing semicolon in the preceding line.

**Fix**:  
Add a semicolon to the reset assignment:  
```data_out <= (others => '0');```  

This ensures proper statement termination and allows the `elsif` branch to be parsed correctly.
