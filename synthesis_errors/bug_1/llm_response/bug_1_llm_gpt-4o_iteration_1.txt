The issue you're encountering here is a syntax error in the VHDL code, specifically near the use of `elsif`. In VHDL, conditional statements within a process should use `elsif` to continue an `if` chain, but typically this syntax rule is correctly interpreted if the preceding syntax is properly terminated.

Upon examining the code, the root of the problem lies in the syntax structure of the conditional statement. Here are the important points:

1. **Incomplete Statement Termination:** The line `data_out <= (others => '0')` is not terminated with a semicolon (`;`). Without the semicolon, the VHDL compiler misinterprets the constructs, resulting in a syntax error.

2. **VHDL Syntax Rules:** In VHDL, every sequential statement should be properly terminated with a semicolon. The lack of a semicolon before the `elsif` keyword causes the syntax ambiguity for the compiler and leads to the reported error.

Here's why the bug occurs:
- When the compiler encounters the `elsif` keyword, it expects it to continue from an `if` statement, but since the preceding line isn't terminated correctly due to the missing semicolon, it generates a syntax error.

To resolve this issue, ensure that every statement is complete and correctly terminated. This involves:
- Adding a semicolon at the end of `data_out <= (others => '0')` in the process block so that it reads `data_out <= (others => '0');`.

Following this correction, the code will adhere to VHDL syntax rules, and the error should be resolved, allowing proper simulation and synthesis of the code.
