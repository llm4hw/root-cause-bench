The error message indicates a syntax issue in the VHDL code at the line with the `elsif` statement, specifically:

```vhdl
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
```

The error is due to the incorrect usage of `elsif`. In VHDL, `elsif` is actually written as `elsif` without the need for a separate `rising_edge` condition. The issue here is that while the `rising_edge` function is correct for detecting clock edges, in the context it seems syntactically incorrect due to missing the necessary keyword to make it relevant to the `elsif`.

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');
elsif clk'event and clk = '1' then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

or you can write:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

Ensure that each `if`, `elsif`, and `else` block in VHDL is properly closed with the appropriate statements, and check syntax rules regarding clock edge detection and other constructs related to condition checks. In this error, ensure your syntax correctly matches VHDL standard structure for sequential logic processes.
