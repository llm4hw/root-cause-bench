The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-2715] syntax error near elsif" is likely due to a syntax issue in the VHDL code. The problem here is missing a semicolon (;) after the line `data_out <= (others => '0')`.

Here's the problematic code snippet from your full code file:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0')
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

The syntax error occurs because VHDL statements need to be properly terminated with a semicolon. Here, the line `data_out <= (others => '0')` is missing this semicolon, which causes the `elsif` to be interpreted as a syntax error.

**To fix the error:**

Add a semicolon to the end of the line `data_out <= (others => '0')`. The corrected code snippet should be:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    data_out <= (others => '0');
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    data_out <= data_in;
end if;
```

This should resolve the syntax error and allow the simulation to proceed.
