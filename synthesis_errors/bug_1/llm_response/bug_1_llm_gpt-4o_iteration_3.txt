The error message you are encountering, "ERROR: [Synth 8-2715] syntax error near elsif [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_1/rtl/top1.vhd:47]", indicates that there is a syntax error in the VHDL code file at the line with `elsif rising_edge(clk) then`. Let's analyze the code to identify why this error is occurring.

Upon inspecting the code, it appears that the `if` and `elsif` statements are being used within a VHDL process block that is sensitive to both `clk` and `rst`. There is a known syntax issue with VHDL involving `if` and `elsif` constructs when handling such constructs, particularly because VHDL requires correct use of syntax within sensitivity lists and process statements. In this case, the syntax for `if-elsif` conditions is being applied incorrectly for the simulator to interpret it correctly.

The primary reason for the syntax error in this context is that VHDL expects each statement to be properly terminated with a semicolon (`;`). Specifically, there is a missing semicolon at the end of the statement associated with `data_out <= (others => '0')` at the line immediately before the `elsif` condition. VHDL requires that statements within process blocks be terminated appropriately, and missing semicolons can cause syntax errors or unexpected parsing issues.

To resolve this issue, ensure that each assignment statement or line of code within process blocks is correctly terminated with a semicolon. In this code, you need to look at the statement `data_out <= (others => '0')` and ensure it is followed by a semicolon:

```vhdl
        if rst = '1' then
            data_out <= (others => '0');  -- Missing semicolon added
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            data_out <= data_in;
```

By adding the semicolon at the end of the `data_out <= (others => '0')` line, the syntax error should be resolved, allowing the VHDL simulator to correctly parse the conditional statement structure.
