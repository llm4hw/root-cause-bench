The error message indicates that there is a named port connection issue when instantiating the `ChildModule` in the `top18` module. Specifically, it states that the named port connection 'b' does not exist for the instance `child_inst` of module `ChildModule`.

Upon examining the Verilog code, this issue occurs because the `ChildModule` only defines the ports `a` and `c`. However, in the instantiation within `top18`, there is an attempt to connect to a port named `b` that does not exist in `ChildModule`. This results in the synthesis error you are seeing.

The root cause of this bug is an incorrect port connection in the `ChildModule` instance. The instantiation attempts to link to nonexistent port `b` because it seems to imply an expectation for connectivity between `in`, `b`, or other intended signalling, but this does not match the ports that `ChildModule` actually declares.

To address this issue, the instantiation should only connect to ports that are explicitly declared in `ChildModule`. In the given code:

- The `ChildModule` has only two ports: `a` (input), `c` (output).
- The module instantiates `ChildModule` and attempts to connect a signal to a nonexistent port `b`.

To resolve the issue, update the instantiation to ensure that only existing ports (`a` and `c`) are used for connections, and determine the intended role of the signal `in` in context with the child module's existing ports, possibly substituting it correctly for `a` or articulating the design requirements more accurately to reinforce clarity on signal usage.
