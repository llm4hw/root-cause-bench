The error you are encountering is due to a mismatch between the port declaration in the `ChildModule` and the port connections in the instantiation of `child_inst` within the `top18` module.

### Bug Explanation:

In your `ChildModule`, you have only two ports declared:

```verilog
module ChildModule (
    input wire a,
    output wire c
);
    assign c = a;
endmodule
```

But in the instantiation of `ChildModule` as `child_inst` inside `top18`, you have attempted to connect to ports `a`, `b`, and `c`:

```verilog
 ChildModule child_inst (
     .a(clk),
     .b(in), // This port does not exist in ChildModule
     .c(x)
 );
```

The error message: `ERROR: [Synth 8-448] named port connection 'b' does not exist for instance 'child_inst' of module 'ChildModule'` is indicating that there is no port `b` in `ChildModule` to connect `in` to.

### Fix:

To fix this error, you need to ensure that the ports you are connecting match exactly with those declared in the module. If the intention was to have a second input port in `ChildModule`, you need to modify the module definition to include it. Otherwise, remove or correct the erroneous port connection.

Assuming you intended to use `a` and `c` as the only ports, remove the incorrect port connection:

```verilog
 ChildModule child_inst (
     .a(clk),
     .c(x)
 );
```

If a second port was intended in `ChildModule`, declare it like this:

```verilog
module ChildModule (
    input wire a,
    input wire b, // Added port definition
    output wire c
);
    assign c = a; // Adjust logic as needed
endmodule
```

And update the logic accordingly if `ChildModule` needs to use `b`.
