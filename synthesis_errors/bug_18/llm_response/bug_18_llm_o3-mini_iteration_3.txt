The error is caused by a reference to a port name ("b") that doesn't exist in the definition of ChildModule. In ChildModule, only two ports are declared—"a" and "c"—so when the instantiation in the top18 module tries to connect a signal using ".b(in)", the synthesis tool cannot locate any matching port. This mismatch results in the error because the named connection is invalid.

The issue can be fixed by ensuring that the port connections in the instantiation match exactly the port names declared in ChildModule. Since ChildModule does not have a port "b", you should remove the erroneous connection or update the module definition accordingly to include the missing port if that was the intent.
