The error message indicates that there is a named port connection 'b' in the instantiation of module 'ChildModule' that does not exist in the module definition. In the provided Verilog code, the 'ChildModule' module has only input ports 'a' and output port 'c', but in the instantiation inside 'top18' module, there is an attempt to connect a non-existent port 'b' to the 'in' signal.

The bug is occurring because the 'b' port is not declared in the 'ChildModule' module, and thus it cannot be connected in the instantiation. To fix this issue, you need to correct the port connection in the instantiation. Modify the instantiation in the top18 module to remove the connection of the non-existent 'b' port. This will ensure that only existing ports ('a' and 'c') are connected correctly.

After fixing this port connection, the error should be resolved and the simulation should proceed without any issues.
