The error occurs because the instantiation of ChildModule in module top18 incorrectly references a port named "b" with the connection ".b(in)". However, the ChildModule is defined with only two ports: "a" and "c". Since there is no port "b" in the ChildModule definition, the simulator (or synthesis tool) reports that the named port connection "b" does not exist.

To fix this error, you need to update the instantiation in top18 so that only valid ports are referenced. For example, if you intended to connect the signal "in" to the input port "a" of ChildModule, you can modify the instantiation as follows:

-----------------------------------------
ChildModule child_inst (
    .a(in),  // Connecting "in" to port "a" (if that's the intended connection)
    .c(x)
);
-----------------------------------------

Alternatively, if the intention was to use a different connection, then update the module declaration of ChildModule to include port "b".

In summary:
‚Ä¢ Bug: The instantiation uses ".b(in)", but "b" is not defined in ChildModule.
‚Ä¢ Cause: A mismatch in the port names between the module definition and its instantiation.
‚Ä¢ Fix: Ensure the instantiation only uses ports "a" and "c", or add the port "b" to ChildModule if that was intended.
