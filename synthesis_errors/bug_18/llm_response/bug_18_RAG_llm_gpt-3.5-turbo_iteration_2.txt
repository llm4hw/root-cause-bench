The bug in the provided code is that in the instantiation of the `ChildModule` within the `top18` module, there is an attempt to connect a port named `.b(in)`, but the actual `ChildModule` definition does not have a port named `b`. This leads to the error message indicating that the named port connection 'b' does not exist for instance 'child_inst' of module 'ChildModule'. The error line in the code is:

```
.b(in),
```

To fix this bug, you need to do one of the following corrections:
1. Update the port connection in the instantiation of `ChildModule` to only include the ports that actually exist in `ChildModule`. In this case, remove the `.b(in),` line from the instantiation since `ChildModule` only has ports `a` and `c`.
2. Modify `ChildModule` if it is necessary to have a port named `b` so that the port connection in the instantiation aligns with the module definition.

By making one of these changes, you can resolve the error related to the named port connection issue.
