The error message you're encountering suggests that there is a problem with the port connections for the instance `child_inst` of the module `ChildModule` in your Verilog code. Specifically, it indicates that there is a named port connection `'.b(in)'` which does not exist in the module `ChildModule`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Port Connection Issue**: The error message '**named port connection 'b' does not exist for instance 'child_inst'**' implies that you are trying to connect to a port named `b` in `ChildModule`. However, if you look at the definition of `ChildModule`, it only has two ports: `a` (input) and `c` (output). There is no port named `b` in `ChildModule`.

2. **Why the Error Occurs**: In Verilog, when you instantiate a module, you need to connect each of the ports defined in the module to corresponding signals or wires in the parent module. The error arises because you are trying to make a connection to a port that does not exist in the child module's definition, which results in the synthesis tools being unable to resolve this connection. Therefore, this is a named connection error.

3. **Impact on Simulation**: During simulation, if the instantiation of a module is incorrect, it will lead to failures when the simulator tries to elaborate the design. In this case, the port connection to a non-existent port will prevent correct elaboration.

### Root Cause:
The root cause of this error is a mismatch between the port declarations in `ChildModule` and the named connections in the instantiation of `child_inst`.

### How to Resolve:
To resolve this error, you need to correct the instantiation of `ChildModule` by ensuring all named connections match the defined port names. In `ChildModule`, there is no port named `b`, so the connection `.b(in)` is incorrect. You should check against the intended logic of your top-level module `top18` and decide how the signal `in` should be used to connect correctly to the `ChildModule`. 

This means:
1. You need to verify or modify which signals should connect to the ports `a` and `c` of `ChildModule`.
2. Remove the `.b(in)` line, and if `in` needs to connect to the input of `ChildModule`, use `.a(in)` for connecting the `in` signal. 

Ultimately, the fix involves aligning the instantiation to the actual port definition to remove discrepancies causing the error.
