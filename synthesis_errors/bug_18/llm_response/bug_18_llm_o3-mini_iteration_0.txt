The error message is indicating that the instantiation of ChildModule in module top18 is trying to connect to a port named "b" (with .b(in)), but ChildModule does not declare any port with that name. In ChildModule, only ports "a" (input) and "c" (output) are defined. This mismatch causes the error because the synthesizer or simulator cannot find a port named "b" in ChildModule.

The problem is occurring because of the incorrect named port mapping in the instantiation of ChildModule â€“ the developer is attempting to reference a non-existent port "b". This typically happens when there is either a typo or an outdated connection reference, where the module port definitions have changed (or were never defined) but the instantiation still refers to the previous or incorrect port name.

To address the problem, you need to update the instantiation so that the names used in the named port connections match exactly with those defined in ChildModule. Essentially, the connection for "in" should be mapped to an existing port (such as "a") and remove or correct any connection that references an invalid port name.

Remember, this explanation does not provide the code fix directly but outlines how the error arises and the conceptual change required to resolve the issue.
