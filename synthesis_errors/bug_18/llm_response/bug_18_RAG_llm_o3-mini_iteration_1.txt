The error is due to a mistake in the named port mapping during the instantiation of ChildModule. In the instantiation, you are trying to connect a signal to a port named “b” (i.e., using .b(in)), but ChildModule doesn’t have any port with the name “b”—it only has ports named “a” and “c.” Here’s what’s happening step by step:

1. In ChildModule, the port declaration is as follows:
  • input wire a
  • output wire c

2. However, in the instantiation inside module top18, you have:
  • .a(clk)
  • .b(in)         -- Error: “b” does not exist in ChildModule
  • .c(x)

3. Since Verilog uses named port mapping, it expects the port names to exactly match those defined in the module. The port “b” is unknown in ChildModule, so the simulator (or synthesis tool) generates an error.

To fix the issue, do one of the following:

• Remove the erroneous port connection .b(in) if it was added by mistake. The instantiation should only reference existing ports, so modify it to:
  ChildModule child_inst (
   .a(clk),
   .c(x)
  );

• Alternatively, if the design intent was to have an additional input port named “b” in ChildModule, then you must update ChildModule’s definition to include that port. For example:
  module ChildModule (
   input wire a,
   input wire b, // Added port
   output wire c
  );
   // Modify the module’s functionality accordingly
  endmodule

Given your code, the simplest fix is to remove or correct the port mapping so that only the defined ports ("a" and "c") are used.

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
