The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-448] named port connection 'b' does not exist for instance 'child_inst' of module 'ChildModule'" indicates that there is an issue in the port mapping of the `ChildModule` instance within the `top18` module.

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Missing Port in Child Module**: The `ChildModule` only has two ports defined: `a` and `c`. However, in the instantiation of `ChildModule`, there is an attempt to connect a third port `.b(in)`, which does not exist in `ChildModule`.
2. **Named Port Binding Error**: This error is occurring because you're trying to map a signal to a named port `b` that does not exist in the module definition of `ChildModule`.

### How to Fix:
To fix this error, you need to eliminate the attempt to connect a non-existent port `b` from the instantiation of `ChildModule`.

Here's how you can correct it:

Remove the `.b(in),` line in the `ChildModule` instantiation within `top18`:

```verilog
 ChildModule child_inst (
     .a(clk),
     .c(x)
 );
```

After this change, the top18 module will correctly instantiate `ChildModule` with the available ports, and the error should be resolved.

This ensures that you're only mapping existing ports in the `ChildModule`, aligning with its definition.

port_name can be either:
• A simple name, which implicitly connects the port to an internal signal with
the same name.

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
