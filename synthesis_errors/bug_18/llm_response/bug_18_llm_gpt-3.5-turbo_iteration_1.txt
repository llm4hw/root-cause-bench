The error message indicates that there is a port connection issue in the instantiation of `child_inst` in the module `top18`.

The bug is occurring because in the instantiation of `ChildModule`, the port `.b` is being connected to `in`, but there is no port named `b` in the `ChildModule` module. The correct ports in `ChildModule` are `a` and `c`, not `b`.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the port connections in the instantiation of `ChildModule` match the port declarations in the `ChildModule` module. Update the port connection from `.b(in)` to `.a(clk)` to correctly connect `a` input port of `ChildModule` to the `clk` input of `top18`.
