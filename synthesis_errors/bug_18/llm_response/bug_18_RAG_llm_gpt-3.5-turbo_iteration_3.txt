The error message states that there is a named port connection ".b(in)" that does not exist for the instance 'child_inst' of the module 'ChildModule'. This issue is occurring because in the instantiation of 'ChildModule' in the 'top18' module, there is an attempt to map the port ".b" to the signal "in", but the 'ChildModule' module does not have a port named "b".

To fix this bug, you need to correct the port mappings in the instantiation of 'ChildModule' in the 'top18' module. Since 'ChildModule' only has two ports named 'a' and 'c', you should remove the port ".b(in)" mapping and adjust the code as follows:

```verilog
module top18 (
    input wire clk,
    input wire in,
    output wire out1
);
    wire x;

    ChildModule child_inst (
         .a(clk),
         .c(x)
    );

    assign out1 = x;

endmodule
```

By removing the incorrect port mapping ".b(in)", the error should be resolved.
