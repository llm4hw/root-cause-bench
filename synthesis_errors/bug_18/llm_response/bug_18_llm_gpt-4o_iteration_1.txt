The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a problem with the port connections for the instance `child_inst` of the module `ChildModule` within the `top18` module. Specifically, the error states that a named port connection 'b' does not exist for the instance 'child_inst' of 'ChildModule'.

### Bug Explanation:

1. **Child Module Definition**: The `ChildModule` defines two ports: an input port `a` and an output port `c`. Notably, there is no port named `b` in the `ChildModule` declaration.

2. **Instance Connection**: In the `top18` module, you are attempting to create an instance of `ChildModule` and connect its ports. The instantiation syntax you use specifies connections for ports `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `b` is supposed to be connected to `in`. 
   - However, since `ChildModule` does not have a port named `b`, this leads to the synthesis tool being unable to find a mapping for `b`, resulting in the error.

### Cause of the Bug:

- **Mismatch in Port Definition and Usage**: You are attempting to connect a signal to a non-existent port `b` on the `ChildModule`. This is the root cause of the error.

### Recommended Fix:

- **Correct the Port Connection**: You need to ensure that the port connections in the instantiation of `ChildModule` match its actual port definitions.
  - If you intended to connect the input `in` to the existing input port `a` of `ChildModule`, the instantiation should use the correct port names as declared.
  
Although I cannot modify the code for you, you should revisit your module instantiation to ensure that port names and connections are aligned with the module's actual interface. Remove or correctly map any references to non-existent ports in your instantiation.
