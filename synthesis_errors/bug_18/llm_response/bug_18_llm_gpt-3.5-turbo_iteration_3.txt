In this code snippet, the error is due to a named port connection 'b' that does not exist in the instantiation of the ChildModule within the top18 module. The ChildModule definition only has ports 'a' and 'c', and there is no port 'b'.

The bug is occurring because the port 'b' is being incorrectly connected in the instance of ChildModule within the top18 module, resulting in a port connection error during synthesis.

To fix this bug, you should remove the '.b(in),' line from the instantiation of ChildModule in the top18 module, as the ChildModule does not have a port named 'b'. Ensure that the port connections in the module instantiation match the ports defined in the module accurately.
