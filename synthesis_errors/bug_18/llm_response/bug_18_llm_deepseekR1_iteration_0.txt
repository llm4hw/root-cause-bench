The error occurs because the instantiation of `ChildModule` in the `top18` module attempts to connect a signal to a port named `b`, but `ChildModule` does not have a port with that name. Here's why:

1. **Module Definition Mismatch**:
   - `ChildModule` is defined with only two ports: input `a` and output `c`.
   - During instantiation (`child_inst`), a connection is made to `.b(in)`, referencing a non-existent port `b`.

2. **Synthesis Tool Detection**:
   - The synthesis tool (Synth 8-448 error) detects that the named port connection `b` does not exist in the target module (`ChildModule`).
   - The error specifically points to line 39 in `top18.v` where the invalid connection `.b(in)` is made.

3. **Root Cause**:
   - The instantiation references ports that don't match the module's actual interface. `ChildModule` has no `b` port, so the connection is invalid.
   - This violates Verilog's module instantiation rules, which require all named connections to match the ports defined in the module.

**How to Fix**:
- **Remove the invalid port connection**: Delete the line `.b(in)` from the instantiation since `ChildModule` has no `b` port.
- **Re-evaluate design intent**: Determine whether:
  - `ChildModule` should be modified to include a `b` port (if missing by mistake), or
  - The signal `in` should be connected to the existing `a` port instead of `clk` (if `clk` was erroneously connected to `a`).
- **Ensure port alignment**: Verify all connections in `child_inst` match the ports declared in `ChildModule` (`a` and `c` only).

**Note**: The current connection `.a(clk)` uses the clock signal as a data input to `ChildModule`, which may be unintended. The fix should align the connections with the actual module interface and design requirements.
