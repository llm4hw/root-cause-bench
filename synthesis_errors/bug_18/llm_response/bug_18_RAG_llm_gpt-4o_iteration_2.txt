The error message indicates that there is an attempt to make a named port connection to a non-existent port 'b' in the instance `child_inst` of the module `ChildModule`.

**Root Cause:**
- The definition of `ChildModule` has only two ports: `a` and `c`. Therefore, when trying to connect a signal to a port named `b` during instantiation, the tool generates an error because `b` does not exist in `ChildModule`.

**Solution:**
To fix the issue, you need to correct the instantiation of `ChildModule` within `top18` by ensuring that all named ports exist in the module definition. Below is the corrected code:

```verilog
module top18 (
    input wire clk,
    input wire in,
    output wire out1
);
    wire x;

     ChildModule child_inst (
         .a(in),  // Connect 'in' to port 'a' of ChildModule
         .c(x)    // Connect output 'c' from ChildModule to 'x'
     );

    assign out1 = x;

endmodule
```

**Explanation of the Fix:**
- The `top18` module should connect the `in` signal to the existing input port `a` of `ChildModule`.
- Make sure that all connections pertain to the ports defined in `ChildModule`, avoiding references to non-existent ports.
