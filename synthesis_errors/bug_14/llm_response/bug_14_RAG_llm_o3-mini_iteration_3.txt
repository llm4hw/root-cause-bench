The error is occurring because the signal "data" is referenced in the assignment (out1 <= data;) but it has not been declared anywhere in the module. The test bench and synthesis tools are complaining because they don't know what "data" is.

To fix this issue, you need to declare "data" in your module before you use it. For example, if "data" is an 8‐bit signal, you can add a declaration like:

   wire [7:0] data;

If "data" is supposed to be an input or driven by some internal logic, adjust the declaration accordingly. Alternatively, if "data" is the result of some other logic that hasn’t been implemented yet, you should complete that logic and make sure "data" is properly defined.

Here’s one possible fix by declaring "data" as a wire:

module top14(
    input wire clk,
    output reg out1
);
    // Declare data as an 8-bit wire (modify width as needed)
    wire [7:0] data;
    
    // Example assignment to data (this should be replaced with your actual logic)
    assign data = 8'hAA; // or any other logic that provides a value to "data"
    
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        out1 <= data;
    end

endmodule
-------------------------------------------------

In summary, the bug is that "data" is being referenced without being declared, and it can be fixed by properly declaring "data" (and ensuring it gets driven a value) within your module.
