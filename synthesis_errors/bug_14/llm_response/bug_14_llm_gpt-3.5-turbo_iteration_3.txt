The bug in the provided code is due to the usage of the signal `data` in the assignment `out1 <= data;` within the always block, but the signal `data` is not declared in the module `top14`. This is why the error message "data is not declared" is generated during synthesis.

To fix this issue, you need to either declare `data` within the `top14` module as an input or reg/output (depending on how it needs to behave) similar to how `out1` is declared. Once `data` is properly declared, the error should be resolved.

Also, for proper synthesis and functionality, ensure that the design intent and interaction between `clk`, `out1`, and `data` are correctly defined in the module.
