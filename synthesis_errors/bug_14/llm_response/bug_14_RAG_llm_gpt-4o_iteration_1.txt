The error message `ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared` indicates that the variable `data` is being used without being declared in the module `top14`. 

**Root Cause:**
The error occurs because, in the line `out1 <= data;`, the variable `data` is referenced without it being declared anywhere in the module. In Verilog, all variables or signals need to be declared before they are used.

**Fix:**
To fix this error, you need to declare `data` within your module `top14`. However, the intended use of `data` is not clear from your provided code. If `data` is supposed to be an input, output, or internal signal, it should be declared accordingly. For example:

1. If `data` is an input, you need to declare it in the module's port list:
    ```verilog
    module top14(
        input wire clk,
        input wire data,  // Declare data as an input
        output reg out1
    );
    ```

2. If `data` is an internal signal computed based on certain logic:
    ```verilog
    module top14(
        input wire clk,
        output reg out1
    );
    
    reg data; // Declare data as a register or wire
    
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        // Add logic to assign a value to data
        data = some_computation(); // Example: assigning a value based on some logic
        out1 <= data;
    end
    ```

3. Additionally, ensure that `data` is correctly assigned a value before it is used in the assignment to `out1`.

By making sure `data` is declared and properly assigned a value before usage, the error will be resolved.
