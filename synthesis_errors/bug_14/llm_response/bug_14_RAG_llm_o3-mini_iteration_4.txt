The problem is that the code uses the signal name "data" (in the statement out1 <= data;) without having declared it anywhere in the module. In other words, the compiler and simulator cannot find any signal or variable called "data", which causes the synthesis error.

To fix the issue, you need to either:

• Declare the missing signal "data" along with its type (for example, a reg or wire) if it is intended to be used in the design.

or

• Replace "data" with the proper, declared signal if it was a mistake.

For example, if "data" was meant to be an input, you should modify the module declaration as follows:

--------------------------------------------------
module top14(
    input wire clk,
    input wire data,   // Added declaration for data
    output reg out1
);
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
--------------------------------------------------

In summary, the bug is caused by referencing an undeclared signal in your always block. Declaring the signal or correcting the reference fixes the error.
