### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because the identifier `data` is referenced in the assignment `out1 <= data;` but **has not been declared** anywhere in the module `top14`. In Verilog, all signals must be explicitly declared before use. The module only declares `clk` (input) and `out1` (output), leaving `data` undefined.

### Why This Happens:
1. **Missing Declaration**:  
   `data` is not listed in the module's port declaration (inputs/outputs), nor is it declared internally as a `reg`, `wire`, or other variable type. The synthesizer cannot resolve what `data` refers to.

2. **Scope Issue**:  
   Verilog requires strict declaration of all identifiers. Since `data` isn't defined within the module or as a port, the tool throws `[Synth 8-1031]` (undefined identifier).

### Fix Required:
- **Declare `data` appropriately** based on its intended role:
  - If `data` should be an **input** to the module, add it to the port list (e.g., `input wire data`).
  - If `data` is an **internal signal**, declare it inside the module (e.g., `reg data` or `wire data`).
- **Ensure declaration placement**: Declarations must appear *before* usage (e.g., before the `always` block).

### Additional Notes:
- The test bench likely tried to drive `data`, but since itâ€™s not a port of `top14`, the module has no way to receive it. This would cause separate errors in the test bench.
- Without knowing the intended purpose of `data`, the fix depends on whether it should be:
  - An input (external signal),
  - An internal register (e.g., `reg data`),
  - Or a wire driven elsewhere (not shown in this snippet). 

This resolves the "not declared" error by providing the synthesizer with a clear definition of `data`.
