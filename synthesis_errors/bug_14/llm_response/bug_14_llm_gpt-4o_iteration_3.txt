The error message indicates that there is an undeclared identifier called `data` being used in your Verilog code on line 29. This is occurring because the Verilog module `top14` attempts to use `data` in an always block for a non-blocking assignment to the output register `out1`, but `data` is not declared anywhere within the scope of the module.

The root cause of this issue is that `data` should be a signal or a variable that exists within the module's scope, whether as an input, output, or internal reg/wire. Without a proper declaration, the synthesis tool cannot understand or resolve the name `data`, leading to the synthesis error, "data is not declared."

To resolve this issue, you must declare `data` within the module `top14`. Depending on what `data` is supposed to represent, it could be added as an input or connected from another module, either directly or via internal logic.

In summary, the problem is the use of an undeclared identifier `data`, and the solution requires ensuring `data` is correctly declared in the module's context so that the Verilog code can synthesize properly.
