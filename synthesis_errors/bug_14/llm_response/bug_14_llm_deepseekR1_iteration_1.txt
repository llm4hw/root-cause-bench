The error occurs because the signal `data` is used in the assignment `out1 <= data;` but has not been declared anywhere in the module. Here's why:

1. **Missing Declaration**: 
   - The module `top14` only declares two signals: `clk` (input) and `out1` (output). 
   - `data` is referenced as a source signal in the always block but is not defined as:
     - An input port
     - A local register (using `reg`)
     - A local wire (using `wire`)
     - A parameter

2. **Tool Interpretation**:
   - The synthesis tool encounters `data` during elaboration and fails to resolve it to any known declaration in the module's scope.
   - This violates Verilog's requirement that all identifiers must be explicitly declared before use.

3. **Root Cause**:
   - The designer likely intended `data` to be either:
     - An **input port** (if it's driven externally)
     - A **locally generated signal** (if it's internal logic)
   - Since neither exists, the tool throws "not declared" error.

**Fix Direction**:
- **Option 1 (Input Port)**:  
  Add `data` as an input port in the module declaration:  
  `module top14( input wire clk, input wire data, output reg out1 );`
  
- **Option 2 (Internal Signal)**:  
  Declare `data` as a local register/wire inside the module and initialize/drive it:  
  `reg data;`  
  *(Note: Requires adding logic to assign `data` a value)*

**Critical Note**:  
The choice depends on the design intent. If `data` is meant to come from outside the module (e.g., from a testbench or another component), it must be an input port. If it's internal state, it needs local declaration and assignment logic.
