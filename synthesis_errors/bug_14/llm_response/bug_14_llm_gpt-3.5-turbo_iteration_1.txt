The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_14/rtl/top14.v:29]" indicates that there is no declaration of the signal or variable named "data" in the Verilog code. 

In the provided Verilog module "top14", there is an assignment statement `out1 <= data;` inside an always block, but the signal `data` is not declared anywhere in the module. This is causing the error during synthesis.

To fix this issue, you need to declare the signal `data` either as an input, output, or reg within the module "top14" so that it can be used in the assignment statement. You can either add `input` or `output` in the module port list or declare it as a reg type signal within the module.

After declaring `data` properly, make sure to assign a valid value or use it correctly in your design logic to avoid any other potential issues during simulation or synthesis.
