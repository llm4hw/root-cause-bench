The error message indicates that the variable `data` is not declared in the Verilog code, specifically in the `always @(posedge clk)` block where `out1` is assigned to `data`. Since `data` is not defined or declared in the module, the synthesis tool throws an error.

To fix this issue, you need to declare and define the `data` variable in the module so that it can be used in the assignment to `out1`. Here is an example of how you can declare and use `data` in your `top14` module:

```verilog
module top14(
    input wire clk,
    output reg out1
);

reg data; // Declaration of the data variable

always @(posedge clk)
begin
    // Assigning a value to data, this can be based on your design
    // data <= some_signal_or_value;

    out1 <= data;
end

endmodule
```

In this modified code snippet, the `data` variable is declared before using it in the `always @(posedge clk)` block. You need to also define what `data` should be assigned, based on your design requirements. By properly declaring and defining `data`, you should be able to fix the error mentioned.
