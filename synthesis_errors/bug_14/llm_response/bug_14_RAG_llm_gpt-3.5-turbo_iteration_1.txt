The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_14/rtl/top14.v:29]" indicates that the variable `data` is not declared in the Verilog module `top14`. This error is occurring because the code is trying to assign the value of `data` to `out1` within the `always @(posedge clk)` block, but `data` has not been defined anywhere in the module.

To fix this issue, you need to declare and define `data` in the `top14` module. If `data` is supposed to be an input to the module, you need to add it to the module ports. For example, you can modify the module declaration as follows:

```verilog
module top14(
    input wire clk,
    input wire data,
    output reg out1
);
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
```

By including `data` as an input wire in the module ports, you can now use it within the `always @(posedge clk)` block without any errors. Remember to also make sure that `data` is properly connected when instantiating the `top14` module in your test bench.
