The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared" indicates that the variable `data` is being used in the code but has not been declared anywhere in the Verilog module. This is why the synthesis tool (or simulator) is unable to resolve what `data` refers to, leading to the error.

In Verilog, before using any variable, it needs to be explicitly declared in the module. The variable `data` should be declared with the appropriate type and width, depending on what it is intended to represent in the design.

### Root Cause:
- The line `out1 <= data;` attempts to assign the value of `data` to `out1`. However, since `data` is not declared anywhere in the module `top14`, the compiler or simulator cannot understand what `data` is supposed to be.
- As a result, the synthesis or simulation tool is throwing an error due to this undeclared reference.

### Potential Fix:
To resolve this error, you will need to declare `data` properly within the module `top14`. Depending on its intended use, you should decide if it should be an input, output, wire, or reg. The declaration would depend on its sourcing and usage in the larger design. Without further context or explanation of what `data` should represent, it is not possible to specify exactly how it should be declared, but ensuring it is declared would address this specific error.
