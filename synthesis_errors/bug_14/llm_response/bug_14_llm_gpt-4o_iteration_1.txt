The error message you're encountering indicates that the variable `data` is not declared in your Verilog module `top14`. In Verilog, every signal or variable that you want to use must be declared within the module or scope where it's being referenced. 

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Undeclared Signal**: The line `out1 <= data;` is attempting to assign the value of `data` to `out1` within an `always` block. However, there is no declaration of `data` anywhere in the provided code snippet. Verilog requires that all signals (inputs, outputs, and internal variables) must be explicitly declared. 

2. **Impact**: Due to the absence of a `data` declaration, the synthesizer is unable to understand where `data` should be derived from, leading to the error `[Synth 8-1031] data is not declared`.

3. **Root Cause**: The root cause is simply that `data` has not been introduced or defined within the `top14` module. Depending on your design intent, `data` should be declared as an input, output, or internal register/wire.

4. **Potential Fix (Conceptual)**: 
   - If `data` is an input to the `top14` module, you should declare it in the module header as an input.
   - If `data` is an internal signal, declare it as a `wire` or `reg` inside the module.
   - If `data` is intended to be connected to another module, ensure it's properly declared with the correct direction and data type.

In summary, the bug is occurring because `data` is being used without a declaration, causing the synthesizer to raise an error due to its inability to glean what `data` represents or where its value should come from. To resolve this, you need to declare `data` appropriately within the `top14` module in accordance with its intended use in your design.
