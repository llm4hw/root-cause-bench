The bug is that the signal "data" is never declared in the module. When the statement

  out1 <= data;

is executed, the synthesis and simulation tools cannot find a definition for "data." This is why you see the error message that "data is not declared" at the specified line.

Why it's occurring:
• In Verilog, you must declare all signals (wires, regs, etc.) that you use.
• The error is raised because the test bench (and the underlying synthesis tool) cannot find any declaration such as "wire data;" or "reg data;" within your module or its inputs/outputs.

How to fix it:
• Declare the variable "data" within your module by adding a declaration line. For example, if "data" is supposed to be a register, you could add:
  reg data;
at the beginning of the module, along with any specification of its width if needed. 
• Alternatively, if "data" was intended to be connected to something or computed within the module (or provided as an input), you must connect it properly by declaring it as an input or internal signal.

For instance, if "data" is supposed to be a 1-bit signal coming from somewhere, you might modify your module as follows:

  module top14(
    input wire clk,
    input wire data,   // Added input declaration for data
    output reg out1
  );

  always @(posedge clk)
  begin
    out1 <= data;
  end

Or, if "data" is supposed to be generated internally, declare it as a reg and assign it a value within your module.

By properly declaring "data," you fix the error.
