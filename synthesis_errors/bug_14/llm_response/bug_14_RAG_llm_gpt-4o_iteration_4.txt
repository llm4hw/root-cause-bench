The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared" indicates that the variable `data` is being used in the code, but it hasn't been declared anywhere in the module. In Verilog, all signals that are used need to be declared, either as inputs, outputs, or internal signals (e.g., wires or registers).

### Root Cause:
The issue arises because the code attempts to assign the value of `data` to `out1` in the always block without having `data` defined or declared in the module `top14`. 

### Fix:
You need to declare the `data` variable or input wherever it is supposed to be coming from, if it is indeed supposed to be part of your design. The solution depends on the actual intent of your design:

1. **Declare `data` as an Input:**
   If `data` is an external signal that should be provided to the module, declare it as an input:
   ```verilog
   module top14(
       input wire clk,
       input wire data,  // Declare data as an input
       output reg out1
   );
       always @(posedge clk)
       begin
           out1 <= data;
       end
   endmodule
   ```

2. **Declare `data` as an Internal Signal:**
   If `data` is supposed to be an internal signal calculated within this module, declare it as a reg or wire, and assign it a value somewhere in the module:
   ```verilog
   module top14(
       input wire clk,
       output reg out1
   );
       reg data;  // Declare data as an internal register

       initial begin  // Or assign it some logic if needed
           data = 1'b0;  // Initialize data, if necessary
       end

       always @(posedge clk)
       begin
           // alternatively update `data` as required by your logic
           out1 <= data;
       end
   endmodule
   ```

Ensure that the declaration matches the intention and connections of your design. Select the appropriate fix based on whether the `data` signal is intended to be an input from outside the module or a computed or predefined internal value.
