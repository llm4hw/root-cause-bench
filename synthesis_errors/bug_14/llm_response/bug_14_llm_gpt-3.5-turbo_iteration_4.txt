The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_14/rtl/top14.v:29]" is occurring because the signal `data` is being used in the always block without being declared or defined anywhere in the code. 

In Verilog, every signal that is being used needs to be declared before it can be used. To fix this issue, you need to declare `data` as either an input or internal signal within the `top14` module, depending on your design requirements. 

Make sure to add a declaration for `data` in the module, either as an input or as an internal signal, before using it in the assignment statement inside the always block.
