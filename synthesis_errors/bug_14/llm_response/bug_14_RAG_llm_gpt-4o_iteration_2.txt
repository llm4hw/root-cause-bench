The error message indicates that the variable `data` is not declared in your Verilog code, yet it is being used in the statement `out1 <= data;`. This error occurs because the Verilog compiler cannot find a declaration for `data` within the given scope, resulting in a compilation error.

### Root Cause:
The root cause of this error is the use of an undeclared variable `data`. In Verilog, all variables and wires must be declared before they are used.

### Solution:
To fix this error, you need to declare the `data` signal appropriately before using it in your `always` block. Depending on your intended functionality, you can declare `data` as a `reg` or `wire`. Since you are using the `<=` (non-blocking assignment operator) inside an `always` block, it's common to declare it as a `reg`. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```verilog
module top14(
    input wire clk,
    output reg out1
);

    // Declare 'data' as a reg or wire; ensure it is driven by some logic.
    reg data;

    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
        out1 <= data; // Assuming 'data' is assigned somewhere else in your design
    end

endmodule
```

However, you should also ensure that `data` is being assigned values somewhere in your design; otherwise, it will not have a meaningful value to be assigned to `out1`. If `data` is supposed to come from another module or part of your design, make sure to connect it correctly.
