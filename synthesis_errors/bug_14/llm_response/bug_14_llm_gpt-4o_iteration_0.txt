The error message indicates that the variable `data` is not declared in the context of the module `top14`. Looking at the code you've provided, the output `out1` is being assigned the value of `data` within an always block. However, there is no signal or variable named `data` defined or declared anywhere in the module `top14`.

This bug occurs because the code is attempting to use a variable that has not been defined. In Verilog, all signals (wires or registers) used within a module must be declared before they can be used. Failing to declare a signal leads to synthesis or simulation errors because the tool does not know how to handle an undeclared name.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that `data` is properly declared and defined within the module `top14` or it should be passed into this module as an input or parameter if it's coming from an external source. If `data` is supposed to be an internal signal, you need to add a declaration for it, potentially as a wire or a reg, depending on your intended design. If `data` is intended to come from outside the module, you need to add it as a port in the module interface.
