The bug in this code is that the variable `data` is being used in the `always` block without being declared or defined anywhere in the module `top14`. This is why the error message `ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared` is being displayed. The Verilog compiler is unable to find the declaration or definition for the `data` variable when assigning it to `out1`.

To fix this bug, you need to either declare `data` as a signal or variable within the module `top14` so that it can be assigned to `out1` properly. If `data` is meant to be an external signal, ensure that it is properly declared in the module's port list. If it is supposed to be an internal variable, you can declare it within the module using `reg`, `wire`, or any appropriate data type based on the intended usage.

Make sure that `data` is correctly defined and is visible within the `always` block for the assignment to `out1` to be successful during simulation.
