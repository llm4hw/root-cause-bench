The error message you are seeing, "ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared," indicates that in the Verilog code for the module `top14`, there is a reference to a signal or variable named `data` on line 29, but this signal has not been declared anywhere in the module.

In Verilog, all wires, registers, inputs, and outputs must be explicitly declared before they are used. When the synthesizer or simulator encounters a variable that has not been declared, it cannot determine its properties or how it should be connected to the rest of the design, leading to the error you observed.

In line 29, the expression `out1 <= data;` attempts to assign the value of `data` to `out1`. However, `data` is not defined anywhere within the scope of the module `top14`. This is likely because `data` was intended to be either an input or an internal signal within the module, but it was never declared.

To understand why this is occurring and how to fix it, you need to:

1. **Identify Intent**: Determine what `data` should represent. Is it supposed to be a module input, or is it an internal signal generated by some other logic inside the module?

2. **Declare Appropriately**: Depending on its intended role, you should explicitly declare `data` in the module. If it is meant to be an input, it should be included in the module's port list, similar to `clk`. If it is an internal signal (a register, for example), it should be declared within the module body.

The root cause of the issue is the absence of this declaration, and you need to define `data` in a way that aligns with its intended purpose in the design logic.
