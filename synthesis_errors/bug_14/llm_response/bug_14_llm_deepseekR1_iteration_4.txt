The error occurs because the signal `data` is used in the assignment `out1 <= data;` but has not been declared anywhere in the module. Here's why:

1. **Missing Declaration**: The module `top14` only declares:
   - Input port `clk`
   - Output register `out1`
   There is no declaration for `data` (as a port, wire, or reg).

2. **Synthesis Error**: During synthesis (indicated by `[Synth 8-1031]`), the tool checks all signal references. Since `data` has no declaration, it fails with "data is not declared".

3. **Possible Causes**:
   - `data` was intended to be an **input port** but was omitted from the port list
   - `data` was meant to be an **internal register/wire** but was never declared
   - A typo in the signal name (e.g., another existing signal was misnamed as `data`)

**How to Fix**:
- **Option 1**: Add `data` as an input port in the module declaration:
  ```verilog
  module top14(
      input wire clk,
      input wire data,  // Add this
      output reg out1
  );
  ```
- **Option 2**: Declare `data` internally if it should be a local signal:
  ```verilog
  reg data;  // Add this before the always block
  ```
- **Option 3**: Replace `data` with a valid signal that exists in the current scope (e.g., if another signal was intended)

**Verification Step**: Check whether `data` should originate from outside the module (requires a port) or be generated internally (requires a local declaration). The fix depends on the intended functionality.
