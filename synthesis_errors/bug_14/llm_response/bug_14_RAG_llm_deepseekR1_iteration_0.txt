### Bug Analysis:
The error occurs because the signal `data` is referenced in the assignment `out1 <= data;` but has not been declared anywhere in the module. In Verilog, all signals must be explicitly declared before use. Since `data` is not defined as an input, output, register, or wire, the synthesis tool throws an undeclared identifier error.

### Why This Happens:
1. **Undeclared Signal**: The module `top14` only declares `clk` (input) and `out1` (output). The signal `data` is missing from the port list and internal declarations.
2. **Synthesis Requirement**: Synthesis tools strictly require explicit signal declarations. Unlike simulation tools (which might tolerate implicit nets in some cases), synthesis fails on undeclared identifiers.

### Fix:
Declare `data` appropriately based on its intended role:
1. **If `data` is an input** (e.g., from another module or testbench):  
   Add it to the module's input port list.
2. **If `data` is an internal register**:  
   Declare it as a `reg` within the module.

#### Fixed Code (assuming `data` is an input):
```verilog
module top14(
    input wire clk,
    input wire data,   // Declare 'data' as an input
    output reg out1
);
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
```

#### Fixed Code (if `data` is an internal register):
```verilog
module top14(
    input wire clk,
    output reg out1
);
    reg data;  // Declare 'data' as an internal register
    
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        out1 <= data;
    end
endmodule
```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Always declare signals**: Every identifier in Verilog must be explicitly declared (as `input`, `output`, `reg`, `wire`, etc.).
- **Port list completeness**: Ensure all signals used in the module are included in the port list or declared internally.
- **Synthesis vs. Simulation**: Synthesis tools are stricter about declarations than simulators. Always resolve undeclared identifiers before synthesis.

This resolves the `data is not declared` error by providing the missing declaration. Choose the fix based on whether `data` is an external input or an internal signal.
