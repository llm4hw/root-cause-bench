In the given Verilog code snippet, the error `ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] data is not declared [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_14/rtl/top14.v:29]` is occurring due to the usage of an undeclared signal `data` in the always block. The `out1` assignment statement `out1 <= data;` is attempting to assign a value to `out1` from `data`, which is not declared or defined anywhere in the module.

To fix this bug, you need to declare and define the signal `data` either as a port in the module declaration or as a module-level variable within the module scope. If `data` is intended to be another input to the module, it should be added as an input port in the module declaration. Otherwise, if `data` is supposed to be a local signal, then it needs to be defined as a reg or wire declaration within the module.

Ensure that `data` is declared either in the input port list like `input wire data;` if it's an input or as a reg or wire inside the module if it's a local signal. Once `data` is properly declared and defined, the error should be resolved, and the code should simulate correctly.

It is essential to correctly declare all signals that are being used within the Verilog design to avoid any synthesis or simulation errors.
