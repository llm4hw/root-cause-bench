The error you're encountering is due to a misuse of indexing on the result of a type conversion in VHDL. The specific line causing the issue is:

```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
```

### Explanation of the Problem

1. **Type Conversion**: The expression `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` converts the integer `counter` to an unsigned vector of 8 bits. This is a standard operation and not problematic on its own.

2. **Result of Type Conversion**: After converting `counter` to an unsigned vector of 8 bits, the function `std_logic_vector()` is then used to convert this unsigned vector to a `std_logic_vector`. This operation itself is also valid.

3. **Indexing Operation**: The core issue emerges when attempting to directly index the result of the `std_logic_vector` conversion with `(7)`. In VHDL, indexing directly on the result of a function call (which is what a type conversion effectively is) is unsupported. This is what the error message `[Synth 8-1753] cannot index the result of a type conversion` is signifying. The synthesizer or simulator does not allow you to index directly on an intermediate conversion result.

### Why the Bug is Occurring

- When you use `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7)`, it tries to access the 8th bit (index 7) of the result of the conversion immediately, which is not allowed by VHDL standards. VHDL syntax does not support such "immediate" indexing on the output of function-like calls.

### How to Fix the Bug

- To correct this, you need to separate the conversion from the indexing operation. You must first store the result of the conversion into an intermediate signal or variable, then perform the indexing on that stored value. By ensuring there's a distinct step, you adhere to VHDL's syntax rules.

```vhdl
signal temp_vector : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);

...

temp_vector <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
out1 <= temp_vector(7);
```

This adjustment ensures the code adheres to VHDL's rules by performing the conversion and indexing in two distinct steps. Consequently, this resolves the encountered error message.
