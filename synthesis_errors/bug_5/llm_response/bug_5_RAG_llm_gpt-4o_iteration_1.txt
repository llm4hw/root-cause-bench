The error you're encountering, "cannot index the result of a type conversion," is because you're trying to index into a result of a type conversion in VHDL, and this isn't allowed directly.

In VHDL, when you use a type conversion function like `to_unsigned`, it returns a new type, in this case, `unsigned`. You're then attempting to convert this `unsigned` directly into a `std_logic_vector` and immediately index it with `(7)`. This operation isn't allowed directly after the type conversion.

Here's why the problem occurs:

1. `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` converts `counter`, which is an `integer`, into an `unsigned` type of 8 bits.
   
2. `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))` then converts this `unsigned` type into a `std_logic_vector`.

The issue comes from trying to access the indexed bit `(7)` from the conversion result directly, without assigning it to an intermediate signal or doing so in a stepwise manner.

To fix this, you need to break this into steps:

1. First, convert `counter` to `unsigned`.
2. Then, convert that `unsigned` to `std_logic_vector`.
3. Finally, assign the indexed bit to `out1`.

Here's how you can modify the code:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
    signal temp_vector : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;

    temp_vector <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
    out1 <= temp_vector(7);

end Behavioral;
```

By using the intermediate signal `temp_vector`, the conversions occur before attempting to index, resolving the error.
