The error occurs because the VHDL code attempts to directly index the result of a type conversion function (`std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(...))`), which is not supported by the synthesis tool. Here's a breakdown:

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Invalid Indexing**: The expression `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7)` tries to:
   - Convert `counter` to an 8-bit `unsigned` vector using `to_unsigned(counter, 8)`
   - Convert that result to `std_logic_vector`
   - Immediately index bit 7 of the converted value
   
2. **Synthesis Limitation**: While this syntax is technically valid in VHDL simulation, **Xilinx Vivado synthesis** (which generated the error) cannot handle indexing applied directly to a type conversion result. The tool interprets the conversion as an atomic operation and rejects the indexing.

### Fix:
Replace the problematic line with either of these solutions:

#### Option 1 (Recommended - Direct Indexing):
```vhdl
out1 <= to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7);
```
**Why this works**: 
- Accesses bit 7 *before* type conversion to `std_logic_vector`
- `to_unsigned` returns an `unsigned` type (which is indexable)
- The bit (type `std_ulogic`) auto-converts to `std_logic`

#### Option 2 (Temporary Signal):
```vhdl
signal counter_vec : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
...
counter_vec <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
out1 <= counter_vec(7);
```

### Corrected Code:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;
    
    -- Fixed line (Option 1)
    out1 <= to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7);
end Behavioral;
```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Synthesis vs Simulation**: Some constructs work in simulation but fail in synthesis due to tool limitations.
- **Indexing Rules**: Always index *concrete signals* or *non-converted types* (like `unsigned`) rather than type conversion results.
- **Bit Selection**: For integers → bit extraction, prefer `unsigned` indexing over nested conversions.
