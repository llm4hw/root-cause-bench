The error message you are encountering is due to the indexing of the result of a type conversion in VHDL. Specifically, the issue arises from attempting to index the result of the type conversion `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` directly, which is not permitted in VHDL.

The problematic line is:
```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
```

This error occurs because you cannot directly index the result of the conversion function. Instead, you need to store the result of `to_unsigned` in an intermediate signal and then index that signal.

To fix the issue, you can use an intermediate signal to store the conversion result before indexing. Here is how you can modify the code:

1. Declare an intermediate signal of type `std_logic_vector`.
2. Assign the result of the conversion to this intermediate signal.
3. Index the intermediate signal to assign it to `out1`.

Here's how you can update the relevant part of the architecture:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
    signal counter_vector : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0); -- Intermediate signal

begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;
    
    -- Assign conversion result to intermediate signal
    counter_vector <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
    -- Index the intermediate signal
    out1 <= counter_vector(7);

end Behavioral;
```

This solution resolves the error by first storing the type conversion result in a signal before attempting to index it.
