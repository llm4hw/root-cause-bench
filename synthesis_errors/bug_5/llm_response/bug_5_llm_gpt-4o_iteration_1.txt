The error you're encountering, `ERROR: [Synth 8-1753] cannot index the result of a type conversion`, indicates that there is an issue with how indexing is being applied to the result of a type conversion in your VHDL code. This error occurs in the line:

```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
```

The root cause of this error is that you're attempting to directly index into a `std_logic_vector` that is returned by the function `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` without first assigning it to an intermediate signal or variable.

In VHDL, when you perform a type conversion and immediately try to index the result, it can cause issues because the indexing cannot be performed on the result of the conversion directly. The type conversion produces a temporary value that doesn't allow for direct indexing in this manner.

To resolve this error, the intermediate result of the conversion should first be assigned to another signal or variable, and then you can index into this intermediate signal. This will allow for proper indexing and avoid the synthesis error, facilitating correct simulation and synthesis of your design.

This explanation should guide you to realizing the need for an explicit intermediate step and retain the intended functionality of your code.
