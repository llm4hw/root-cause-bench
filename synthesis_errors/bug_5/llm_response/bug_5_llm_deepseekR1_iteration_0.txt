The error occurs due to a syntax issue in the VHDL type conversion and indexing operation. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Problematic Line**:
   ```vhdl
   out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
   ```

2. **Root Cause**:
   - The expression `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))` is a function call that returns an 8-bit `std_logic_vector`.
   - VHDL requires that indexing (e.g., `(7)`) be applied directly to an array object, but here it's incorrectly applied to the **result of a type conversion function** (`std_logic_vector(...)`).
   - The parser interprets the double closing parentheses `))` as terminating both the `to_unsigned` and `std_logic_vector` functions, leaving the `(7)` index dangling without a valid target.

3. **Synthesis Tool Limitation**:
   - The Xilinx synthesizer (as indicated by `[Synth 8-1753]`) explicitly prohibits indexing the result of type conversions. This is a known tool restriction for certain complex expressions.

4. **Type Mismatch Insight**:
   - `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` already returns an `unsigned` type (which is indexable), but the redundant `std_logic_vector` conversion wraps it in another function call, breaking the indexing operation.

**Fix Direction**:
- Remove the problematic `std_logic_vector` conversion since it's unnecessary for bit indexing.
- Directly index the result of `to_unsigned` (which is natively indexable) and assign the bit to `out1`.
- Alternatively, split the operation into two steps: first convert the counter to a vector signal, then index that signal.

**Correct Approach Example**:
```vhdl
out1 <= to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7); -- Direct indexing of unsigned
```
*OR*
```vhdl
signal counter_vec : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
...
counter_vec <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
out1 <= counter_vec(7);
``` 

Both approaches avoid indexing the result of a type conversion function, complying with synthesis tool constraints.
