### Bug Analysis
The error occurs due to incorrect syntax when trying to index the result of a type conversion function. In VHDL, you cannot directly apply an index to a type conversion function call in a single expression. The line causing the error is:

```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
```

Here's the breakdown:
1. `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` converts the integer `counter` to an 8-bit `unsigned` vector.
2. `std_logic_vector(...)` converts the result to `std_logic_vector`.
3. `(...)(7)` attempts to directly index the 7th bit of the conversion result.

VHDL does not allow indexing the result of a function call in this manner. The synthesis tool (Xilinx Vivado) specifically rejects this syntax with error `[Synth 8-1753]`.

### Solution
Fix the syntax by either:
1. **Indexing before conversion** (recommended):  
   Extract the bit from the `unsigned` vector before conversion:
   ```vhdl
   out1 <= to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7);
   ```
   Since `to_unsigned` returns an `unsigned` type, and indexing it yields a `std_ulogic` (compatible with `std_logic`), no extra conversion is needed.

2. **Use a temporary signal**:  
   Declare an intermediate signal and index it:
   ```vhdl
   signal counter_vec : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
   ...
   counter_vec <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
   out1 <= counter_vec(7);
   ```

### Corrected Code
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;
    -- Fixed: Index the unsigned vector directly
    out1 <= to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7);
end Behavioral;
```

### Explanation
- **Why it works**: `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` returns an 8-bit `unsigned` vector (indexed `7 downto 0`). Indexing bit `7` gives the MSB as a `std_ulogic`, which is directly assignable to `out1` (type `std_logic`).
- **Efficiency**: Avoids unnecessary double conversion and uses native VHDL indexing rules.
- **Synthesis Compatibility**: All tools support indexing native vector types like `unsigned`.

This fix resolves the synthesis error while maintaining the original functionality (outputting the MSB of the 8-bit counter).
