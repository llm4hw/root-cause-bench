The error message indicates that there is a problem with indexing the result of the type conversion from integer to unsigned in line 55 of your code:

```out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);```

The issue occurs because you are trying to perform both type conversion and indexing in a single statement, which can lead to synthesis issues. To fix this bug, you can split the statement into two separate lines; one for type conversion and the other for indexing:

``` 
signal temp_unsigned : unsigned(7 downto 0);
temp_unsigned <= to_unsigned(counter, 8);
out1 <= temp_unsigned(7);
```

By splitting the conversion and indexing into different lines, you avoid the error related to indexing the result of a type conversion. This separation should resolve the issue you encountered during the simulation.
