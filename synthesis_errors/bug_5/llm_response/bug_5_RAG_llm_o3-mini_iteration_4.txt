The error is not in the arithmetic or data widths but in the fact that you are trying to index the result of a function call directly. In other words, the expression

  std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))

creates a temporary vector that is not a “named” signal or variable, so VHDL (or at least your simulation/synthesis tool) does not allow the immediate indexing "(7)" on that temporary result.

Why is it occurring?
• When you write:
  out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
 you are attempting to index bit 7 of the temporary std_logic_vector, but many VHDL tools (and perhaps the standard you are using) do not allow slicing/indexing on an expression that is not a signal. It must be a “real” object (like a signal or variable) that has been declared.

How can it be fixed?
There are several equivalent fixes. One common approach is to assign the conversion result to an intermediate signal and then index that signal. For example:

-------------------------------------------------
architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
    signal temp_vector : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;
    
    temp_vector <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
    out1 <= temp_vector(7);
end Behavioral;
-------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, you could combine the conversion with element conversion (if your tool allows indexing on an UNSIGNED expression), like so:

  out1 <= std_logic(to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7));

Either approach ensures that the indexed object is “stable” (or is an object) rather than a temporary result from a function call. This resolves the error the test bench is reporting.
