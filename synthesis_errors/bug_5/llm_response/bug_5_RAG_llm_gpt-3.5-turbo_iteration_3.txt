The bug in the provided code is due to the expression `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7)`. This error is happening because the synthesis tool is unable to apply the index operation to the result of the type conversion directly.

To fix this issue, you can modify the line assigning to `out1` as follows:

```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7 downto 7));
```

This change specifies the range directly instead of using an index operation, which should resolve the error related to type conversion indexing.
