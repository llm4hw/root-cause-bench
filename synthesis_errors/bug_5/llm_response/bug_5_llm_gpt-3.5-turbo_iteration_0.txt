The bug in the provided code is due to an incorrect type conversion. The line in question is attempting to convert the counter value, which is an integer, to an 8-bit unsigned vector using the `to_unsigned` function, and then extract the MSB (bit index 7) using the `(7)` index. However, the error arises because the indexing operation cannot be performed directly on the result of the type conversion.

To fix this issue, you should modify the code to first convert the counter value to an 8-bit unsigned vector, and then assign this value to `out1`. This can be achieved by splitting the operation into two steps: first a type conversion to `unsigned` and then using `resize` or `to_std_logic_vector` to convert the `unsigned` value to `std_logic_vector`.

By adjusting this sequence of operations, the error should be resolved, and the code will be able to successfully assign the MSB of the converted value to `out1`.

It is important to note that the error was generated during simulation due to the indexing operation being directly applied to the result of the type conversion, which is not supported in this context.
