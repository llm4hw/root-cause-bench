The error you are encountering is due to attempting to directly index the result of a type conversion without storing it in an intermediate signal or variable. The line causing the issue is:

```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
```

Here's a breakdown of the problem:

1. **Type Conversion**: `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` converts the `counter`, which is of type `integer`, into `unsigned` representation with a bit width of 8.

2. **Conversion to std_logic_vector**: The next step is converting this `unsigned` type to a `std_logic_vector`.

3. **Indexing Result**: The attempt `(7)` is meant to extract a single bit from the resulting vector. However, the problem is this operation is attempted directly on the result of the conversion in one step without an intermediate assignment.

The issue arises because many synthesis tools and simulators do not allow indexing directly on the result of a type conversion in VHDL syntax. The language standard expects transformations and indexing to be done in separate operations to maintain clarity and avoid ambiguities.

**Causes of the Bug:**
- The compiler/simulator doesn't know how to handle direct indexing of an expression involving a conversion.
- In VHDL, certain operations on converted data types might require intermediate storage to ensure that operations are performed on a consistent data type.

**Solution:**
To fix the bug, you need to use an intermediate signal. Perform the type conversion, store it in an intermediate signal, and then access the specific bit. This helps the simulator/parser handle the indexing operation correctly:

1. Declare an intermediate signal to hold the converted value.
2. Assign the conversion result to this signal.
3. Perform the indexing on the intermediate signal.

While I cannot provide the exact code as per instruction, the solution involves the separation of operations into these discrete steps. This method would allow the indexing to be performed correctly in a clearer and more error-free manner.
