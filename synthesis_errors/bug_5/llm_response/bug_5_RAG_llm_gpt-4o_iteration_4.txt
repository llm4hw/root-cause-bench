The error you are encountering is due to a type conversion issue in VHDL. The problem arises from trying to directly index the result of a type conversion expression in a single line, which is not allowed.

### Explanation

In your code, you are attempting to directly index the result of the `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))` expression by `(7)`. However, VHDL does not allow indexing on the result of a type conversion expression directly. This is because the expression `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))` is evaluated as a whole, and you cannot apply an index to it in the same statement.

### Fix

To fix this, you need to separate the conversion from the indexing. You can do this by using an intermediate signal to hold the converted value. Here's how you can refactor the code:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
    signal converted_counter : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0); -- Intermediate signal
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;

    converted_counter <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8)); -- Conversion
    out1 <= converted_counter(7); -- Indexing

end Behavioral;
```

### Summary

- **Cause of Error:** Directly indexing the result of a type conversion expression in a single line is not allowed in VHDL.
- **Solution:** Use an intermediate signal to store the converted value, then perform indexing on this signal. This separates the conversion and indexing operations into distinct steps, which is valid in VHDL.
