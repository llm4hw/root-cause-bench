The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1753] cannot index the result of a type conversion" is occurring because you are trying to directly index into the result of a function call `to_unsigned(counter, 8)`. In VHDL, you cannot index directly into a type conversion result without storing it in an intermediate signal or variable first.

Here is the breakdown and how you can fix it:

1. **Error Occurrence**: 
   - The line `out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);` is attempting to convert the integer `counter` to an `unsigned` vector, convert it to `std_logic_vector`, and then index the result to extract the most significant bit (MSB).

2. **Why it Occurs**: 
   - VHDL does not allow direct indexing into the result of a conversion in the same line due to how type conversion and bit selection is handled.

3. **Fix**:
   - Introduce an intermediate signal to store the result of `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))`. Then index this signal to assign `out1`.

Here's how you can modify the code to fix the error:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
    signal counter_vector : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;
    
    -- Convert integer to std_logic_vector and store in intermediate signal
    counter_vector <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));
    
    -- Index the intermediate signal to get the most significant bit (bit 7)
    out1 <= counter_vector(7);

end Behavioral;
```

This modification stores the converted `std_logic_vector` in `counter_vector`, then accesses bit 7 directly from that signal. This adheres to VHDL's type handling rules and fixes the error.
