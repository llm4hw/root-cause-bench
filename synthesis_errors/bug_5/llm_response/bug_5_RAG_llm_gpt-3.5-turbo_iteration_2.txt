The bug in the code is that the conversion result of `to_unsigned` is being directly indexed like an array. In your line: `out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);`, you are trying to access the 7th element of the converted `std_logic_vector`, which is not allowed because this is not a concatenation of elements.

To fix this issue, you should directly assign the result of the type conversion to `out1`. Here is the corrected line: 

```out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8));```

This way, you are converting the `counter` to an 8-bit unsigned integer, and then converting that into a `std_logic_vector`, which is then assigned to `out1`. This change should resolve the error you are encountering.
