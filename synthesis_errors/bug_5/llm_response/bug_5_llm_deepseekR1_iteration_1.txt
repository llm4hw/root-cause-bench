The error occurs because of incorrect syntax when trying to index the result of a type conversion function in VHDL. Specifically:

1. **Root Cause**: The expression `std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7)` attempts to directly index the result of the `std_logic_vector()` type conversion function. VHDL syntax does not allow indexing function results in this manner because:
   - Type conversions (`std_logic_vector()` in this case) are treated as function calls
   - Function return values cannot be directly indexed in the same expression where they are called
   - The extra closing parenthesis after `8))` creates invalid syntax for indexing

2. **Tool Limitation**: The synthesis tool explicitly states it "cannot index the result of a type conversion," which is consistent with VHDL's grammar rules where function calls cannot be directly indexed.

3. **Logical Intent**: The code aims to extract bit 7 (MSB) of an 8-bit unsigned representation of `counter`. However, the current syntax violates VHDL's operator precedence and indexing rules.

**Fix Approach**:
- Instead of indexing the type-converted result, index the `unsigned` vector *before* conversion
- Use: `to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7)` which:
  - Creates an 8-bit unsigned vector
  - Indexes bit 7 (std_logic)
  - Avoids unnecessary type conversion
- Alternatively, use a temporary signal or variable to hold the converted vector and index that signal

This resolves both the syntax error and the tool limitation by eliminating direct indexing of a type conversion result.
