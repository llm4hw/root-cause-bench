### Bug Analysis
The error occurs due to incorrect syntax when indexing a type-converted value. The problematic line is:
```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
```

### Why the Error Occurs:
1. **Type Conversion and Indexing**: 
   - `to_unsigned(counter, 8)` converts the integer `counter` to an 8-bit `unsigned` vector.
   - `std_logic_vector(...)` then converts this to `std_logic_vector`.
   - The syntax `(...)(7)` attempts to directly index bit 7 of the result, but the parentheses are misplaced.

2. **Parenthesis Mismatch**:
   - The expression has an extra closing parenthesis after `8)`, causing the parser to interpret the indexing `(7)` incorrectly.
   - The correct structure requires proper grouping: the indexing operation `(7)` should directly follow the vector expression without an extra parenthesis.

### Fix:
Change the line to:
```vhdl
out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
```
**Explanation**:
- Remove the extra parenthesis after `8)` to properly associate the indexing operation `(7)` with the converted vector.
- This correctly accesses bit 7 (MSB) of the 8-bit vector.

### Corrected Code:
```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity top5 is
    Port ( clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
           rst : in  STD_LOGIC;
           out1 : out STD_LOGIC);
end top5;

architecture Behavioral of top5 is
    signal counter : integer range 0 to 255 := 0;
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            counter <= 0;
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            if counter < 255 then
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end if;
        end if;
    end process;
    -- Fixed line: removed extra parenthesis
    out1 <= std_logic_vector(to_unsigned(counter, 8))(7);
end Behavioral;
```

### Key Points:
- **Indexing Converted Values**: Always ensure the indexing operation `(index)` directly follows the vector expression without extra parentheses.
- **Alternative Approach**: You could also use:
  ```vhdl
  out1 <= to_unsigned(counter, 8)(7); -- Directly index the unsigned vector
  ```
  This avoids the redundant conversion to `std_logic_vector` since indexing works on `unsigned` types.

This fix resolves the synthesis error by correcting the syntax for indexing a type-converted value.
