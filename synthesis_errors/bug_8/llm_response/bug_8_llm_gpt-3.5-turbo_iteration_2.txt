The bug in the provided code is that the signal `signal2` is being assigned a value without being declared in the entity or architecture of the design. This is causing the error message stating that `signal2` is not declared.

To fix this issue, you need to declare `signal2` in the architecture of `top8` entity. You can add it as a signal in the declaration section along with `signal1`.

After declaring `signal2` in the architecture, the assignment to `signal2` inside the process block can be done correctly without causing any errors during simulation.

Make sure to add the necessary signal declaration in the architecture section of the code to resolve this bug.
