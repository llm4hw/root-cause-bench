The error message indicates that there is a problem with the signal `signal2` in the Verilog code. The error is occurring because `signal2` has not been declared in the signal declarations part of the code, and therefore the assignment `signal2 <= '0';` is causing the synthesis tool to flag it as an undeclared signal.

To fix this issue, you need to declare `signal2` before using it in the architecture section of the code. Add a declaration for `signal2` similar to how `signal1` is declared:

```vhdl
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Add this line to declare signal2
```

By adding this line to declare `signal2`, you will resolve the error of `signal2` not being declared and allow the assignment `signal2 <= '0';` to work correctly during synthesis.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
