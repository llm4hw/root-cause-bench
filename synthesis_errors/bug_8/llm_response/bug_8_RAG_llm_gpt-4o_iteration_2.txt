The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1031] signal2 is not declared" indicates that the code is attempting to assign a value to a signal named `signal2`, but this signal has not been declared anywhere within the VHDL file `top8.vhd`.

### Root Cause:
The error occurs because `signal2` is used within the process block, specifically in the line `signal2 <= '0';`, but there is no declaration for `signal2` in the architecture. In VHDL, all signals must be declared before they are used, either within the architecture where they are utilized or as ports of the entity.

### How to Fix:
To fix this error, you need to declare `signal2` within the architecture of the VHDL code. You can do this by adding a signal declaration for `signal2` similar to what has been done for `signal1`.

Here is how you can fix the code:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC; -- Add this line to declare signal2
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal2 <= '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

By adding the line `signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC;`, you declare `signal2` correctly, which resolves the error. The signal is now recognized by the synthesis tool, allowing the assignment within the process block to proceed without issues.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
