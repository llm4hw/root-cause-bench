The error message indicates that `signal2` is not declared in the code. This error is occurring because within the given VHDL file for the `top8` module, the signal `signal2` is being used without having been declared beforehand. The process block attempts to assign a value to `signal2`, which has not been defined as a signal in the architecture.

To fix the error, you need to declare `signal2` within the architecture of the `top8` module before you use it in the process block. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add a signal declaration for `signal2` with the appropriate type in the architecture's declarative region before the `begin` statement. Assuming `signal2` is intended to be of the `STD_LOGIC` type (like `signal1`), you can declare it as follows:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Declaration of signal2
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal2 <= '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

By declaring `signal2` in the architecture, the error should be resolved as `signal2` will now be recognized within the VHDL code.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
