The error message indicates that "signal2" is not declared before the line where it's being assigned a value in the code. It seems like the variable "signal2" is missing from the signal declarations section of the Verilog code. To fix this, you need to declare "signal2" as a signal before trying to assign a value to it.

To resolve the issue, you can declare "signal2" as a signal in the architecture section before using it in the process. Here's an updated version of your code with the declaration of "signal2":

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Add this line
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal2 <= '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

By adding the declaration of "signal2" as a signal, the error should be resolved, and the simulation should proceed without any issues related to "signal2" not being declared.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
