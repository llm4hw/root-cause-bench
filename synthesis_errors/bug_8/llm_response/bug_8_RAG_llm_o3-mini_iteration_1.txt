The error occurs because the code assigns a value to signal2 inside the process, but signal2 has never been declared in the architecture. In Verilog or VHDL, every signal that you use must be declared before it is referenced. Here, the test bench (or synthesis tool) complains because it sees an assignment to signal2, which it doesn’t recognize.

To fix the error, you have two options:

1. If signal2 is actually needed, declare it in the architecture section. For example, in VHDL you can add:
   ‑‑ Declaration in the architecture (before the begin statement)
   signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC;
   
2. If signal2 was mistakenly included and is not needed, simply remove the assignment statement (signal2 <= '0';) from the process.

This will resolve the error and allow your simulation and synthesis to proceed correctly.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
