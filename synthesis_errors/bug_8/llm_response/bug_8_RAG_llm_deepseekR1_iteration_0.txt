### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because `signal2` is used in the design but **never declared** in the architecture. Here's why:

1. **Declaration Scope**:  
   The architecture `Behavioral` only declares `signal1`:
   ```vhdl
   signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
   ```
   There is no declaration for `signal2`.

2. **Erroneous Usage**:  
   In the process block, `signal2` is assigned a value during reset:
   ```vhdl
   if rst = '1' then
        signal2 <= '0';  -- 🚨 UNDECLARED SIGNAL
   ```

3. **Synthesis Error**:  
   The synthesis tool (Xilinx Vivado) detects that `signal2` has no declaration and throws:  
   `[Synth 8-1031] signal2 is not declared`

---

### Fix
**Option 1: Use `signal1` instead of `signal2`**  
Since `signal1` is the only signal driving the output `out1`, it's likely `signal2` was a typo. Replace `signal2` with `signal1` in the reset branch:
```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    signal1 <= '0';  -- ✅ CORRECTED
```

**Option 2: Declare `signal2` (if intentionally needed)**  
If a second signal is required, declare it in the architecture:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- ✅ ADD MISSING DECLARATION
begin
    ...
```

---

### Corrected Code
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- ONLY signal1 EXISTS
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';  -- 🟢 FIXED: Assign to signal1
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;
    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

### Key Takeaways
1. **Signal Declaration**: All internal signals must be declared in the architecture's declaration section (before `begin`).
2. **Synthesis vs. Simulation**: Some simulators may not catch undeclared signals during behavioral simulation, but synthesis tools will fail.
3. **Best Practice**: Double-check signal names for typos. Tools like linters or HDL checkers can catch these issues early.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
