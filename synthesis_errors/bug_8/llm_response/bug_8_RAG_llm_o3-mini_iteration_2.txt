The bug is that the process assigns a value to signal2 even though it hasn't been declared anywhere in the architecture. In the provided code, only signal1 is declared, so the reference to signal2 (signal2 <= '0';) causes the error.

Why is it occurring?
• When the simulation (or synthesis) tool encounters signal2, it cannot find any declaration for it.
• This error is generated by the test bench because it is trying to simulate behavior described in the code, but the simulator cannot resolve signal2.

How can it be fixed?
• If signal2 is intended to be a separate signal, you must declare it in the architecture. For example, add:
  signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
 before the begin statement.
• If signal2 was intended to be signal1 (or another declared signal), correct the assignment accordingly.

By properly declaring signal2 or fixing the reference, the error will be resolved.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
