The bug is that signal2 is used in the process but is not declared anywhere in the architecture. In VHDL, every signal you use must be explicitly declared. Since signal2 is never declared in the architecture, the simulation test bench (and synthesis tools) issue an error about signal2 not being declared.

To fix the issue, simply declare signal2 in the architecture section before using it in the process. For example, add the following declaration along with your other signal declarations:

   
  signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC;

Once signal2 is declared, the test bench will recognize it and the error message will disappear.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
