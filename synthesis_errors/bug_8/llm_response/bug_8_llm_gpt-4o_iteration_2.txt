The error message indicates that there is an attempt to assign a value to a signal named `signal2`, but `signal2` is not declared anywhere within the architecture of the VHDL module. This results in a synthesis error because VHDL requires that all signals used within a design must be explicitly declared before they can be referenced or assigned a value.

Let's break down why this error is occurring:

1. **Signal Declaration**: VHDL requires all signals that are used within a process to be declared beforehand. The architecture in the provided code only declares one signal, `signal1`, but does not declare `signal2`.
2. **Undefined Reference**: When the process attempts to assign a value to `signal2` on a reset (`rst = '1'`), the compiler cannot find a declaration for `signal2`, resulting in the error message.

To resolve this issue, you need to declare the signal `signal2` just like `signal1` is declared. This declaration should occur in the declarative part of the architecture before being used in the process. 

To summarize, the root cause of the error is the reference to an undeclared signal `signal2`. By declaring `signal2` in the architecture where it is intended to be used, this error would be resolved, allowing the synthesis to proceed without encountering an issue related to undeclared signals.
