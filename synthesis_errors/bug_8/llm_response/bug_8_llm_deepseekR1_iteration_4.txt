The error occurs because the signal `signal2` is referenced in the assignment `signal2 <= '0';` but has not been declared anywhere in the architecture. Here's why:

1. **Declaration Issue**: The architecture only declares one signal:  
   `signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';`  
   There is no declaration for `signal2` anywhere in the code.

2. **Synthesis Failure**: During synthesis, the tool encounters `signal2` at line 46 but cannot resolve it because:
   - It isn't declared in the architecture's declarative region (before `begin`)
   - It isn't a port of the entity
   - It isn't a globally visible object

3. **Probable Cause**: This is likely a typo where the designer intended to reset `signal1` instead of `signal2`, as `signal1` is:
   - The only declared signal
   - Used in the clocked process (`signal1 <= not signal1`)
   - Connected to the output (`out1 <= signal1`)

**Fix Approach**:  
- **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Replace `signal2` with `signal1` in the reset assignment since `signal1` is the only signal being used elsewhere.  
- **Option 2**: Declare `signal2` properly in the architecture if a second signal was intentionally needed (though inconsistent with current usage).

The reset logic should operate on the same signal (`signal1`) that the process modifies during normal operation to maintain design consistency.
