Based on the error message and code analysis, here's the breakdown of the bug and solution:

**The Bug**: `signal2` is being assigned in the process (`signal2 <= '0';`), but it's never declared in the architecture's declaration section.

**Why it's occurring**:
1. In the architecture's declarative region, only `signal1` is declared (`signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';`)
2. The reset branch of the process tries to assign to `signal2`, which doesn't exist in the scope
3. VHDL requires all signals to be explicitly declared before use
4. The error occurs during synthesis/elaboration when the tool checks signal declarations

**Fix**:
Replace `signal2` with the correct signal name `signal1` in the reset assignment:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    signal1 <= '0';  -- Changed signal2 to signal1
```

**Corrected Code Section**:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';  -- CORRECTED LINE
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

**Explanation**:
The design clearly intends to manipulate `signal1` throughout:
1. `signal1` is declared and initialized
2. It's toggled on clock edges
3. It's connected to output `out1`
4. The reset clause should initialize this same signal (`signal1`), not a non-existent `signal2`

This fix maintains the intended behavior where:
1. Reset sets the output to '0'
2. Normal operation toggles the output on each clock cycle
3. All signals are properly declared and scoped

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
