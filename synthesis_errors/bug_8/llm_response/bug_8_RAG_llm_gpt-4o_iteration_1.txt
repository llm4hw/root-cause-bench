The error message indicates that there is an attempt to assign a value to a signal named `signal2`, but this signal has not been declared in the code file provided. This issue is arising because VHDL requires all signals to be explicitly declared before they are used in the code.

In the provided VHDL code, you have a signal declaration for `signal1`, but there is no corresponding declaration for `signal2`. Since the code attempts to make an assignment to `signal2` during the reset condition, the synthesizer cannot process this line because `signal2` is undefined.

To fix this issue, you need to declare `signal2` before using it. Here's how you can modify the architecture section of your code to include a declaration for `signal2`:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Declare signal2
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal2 <= '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

By adding the declaration `signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';`, you define `signal2` as a signal of type `STD_LOGIC`, ensuring that it can be used within the process for assignments. This should resolve the error message you are encountering.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
