The error is caused by the fact that the code is trying to assign a value to "signal2", but no signal named "signal2" has been declared in the architecture. In the provided code, only "signal1" is declared:

  signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';

However, later in the process, the code contains:

  if rst = '1' then
    signal2 <= '0';

Since "signal2" isn’t declared anywhere, the synthesis (and simulation) tools generate an error.

To fix this bug, you have two options:

1. If "signal2" is needed, explicitly declare it in the architecture section, like so:

  signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';

This will allow the assignment in the process to work correctly.

2. If the intended signal was "signal1" (and "signal2" was a typo), then update the assignment to:

  if rst = '1' then
    signal1 <= '0';
  …

Choose the appropriate fix based on the intended functionality of your module.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
