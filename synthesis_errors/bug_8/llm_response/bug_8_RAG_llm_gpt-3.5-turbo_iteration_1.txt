The error message is stating that "signal2 is not declared" at line 46 in the file top8.vhd. This error occurs because the signal2 is being assigned a value without being declared in the architecture. To resolve this issue, you need to declare signal2 in the signal declaration section before using it in assignments.

You can fix this issue by adding the declaration of signal2 in the architecture section like this:

```vhdl
signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
```

By adding the declaration of signal2 with an initial value in the architecture, the error message should be resolved, and the simulation should run without issues.

Let‚Äôs look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal ‚ÄúReset_TB‚Äù is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
Ô¨Årst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deÔ¨Åned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
