The error message you're encountering is indicating that `signal2` has not been declared within your VHDL code. The line causing the error is trying to assign a value to `signal2` without it being defined previously. Here’s a breakdown of the issue and how you can fix it:

### Root Cause

1. **Undeclared Signal**: The signal `signal2` is used in the process but is not declared anywhere in the code. VHDL requires all signals used within a design to be declared either as part of the port definitions for the entity, or as internal signals within the architecture.

### How to Fix

To resolve this issue, you need to declare `signal2` in the architecture. Since the signal seems to have a specific functional purpose during a reset (`rst` condition), it should be declared similarly to how `signal1` is declared. 

Here is the corrected code:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity top8 is
    Port ( clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
           rst : in  STD_LOGIC;
           out1 : out STD_LOGIC);
end top8;

architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Declare signal2 here
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal2 <= '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

By adding the declaration `signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0';` in the architecture block, the error should be resolved. Now, `signal2` is properly declared and can be used in the process.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
