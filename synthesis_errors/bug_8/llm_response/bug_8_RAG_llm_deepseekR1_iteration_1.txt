Based on the error message and code analysis, here's the bug explanation and solution:

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Undeclared Signal**: The error `signal2 is not declared` occurs because `signal2` is referenced in the code but hasn't been declared in the architecture's declaration section.
2. **Location**: In the process block, `signal2` is assigned a value (`signal2 <= '0';`) when reset is active.
3. **Declaration Missing**: The architecture only declares `signal1` (`signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';`). There's no corresponding declaration for `signal2`.

### Why This Occurs:
- VHDL requires all signals to be explicitly declared before use
- The synthesis tool (Xilinx Vivado) detects this undeclared signal during compilation
- Line 46 (`signal2 <= '0';`) attempts to assign a value to a non-existent signal

### Solution:
**Change the reset assignment to use `signal1` instead of `signal2`**:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    signal1 <= '0';  -- Changed from signal2 to signal1
```

### Corrected Code Section:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Only signal1 declared
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';  -- Fixed: Assigns to declared signal1
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;
    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

### Why This Fix Works:
1. Maintains design intent (resetting the flip-flop state)
2. Uses the already-declared `signal1` that drives the output
3. Eliminates the reference to the undeclared `signal2`
4. Preserves the toggle functionality on clock edges

### Additional Notes:
- If you actually need a `signal2` (unlikely from context), you would need to declare it:
  ```vhdl
  signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC;  -- Add this below signal1 declaration
  ```
- However, since `out1` is driven by `signal1` and the clock process only toggles `signal1`, using `signal1` in reset is the correct fix.

This change resolves the synthesis error while maintaining the original functionality of a resettable toggle flip-flop.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
