The error occurs because the signal `signal2` is referenced in the code but has not been declared. In VHDL, all signals must be explicitly declared before they can be used.

### Root Cause:
1. **Missing Declaration**:  
   The architecture declares `signal1` but does not declare `signal2`:
   ```vhdl
   signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Only signal1 is declared
   ```
   When `signal2` is assigned (`signal2 <= '0';`), the tool throws an error because `signal2` does not exist.

2. **Typo/Semantic Error**:  
   The assignment to `signal2` in the reset clause (`if rst = '1' then`) is likely a typo. Given the context, the reset should initialize `signal1` (the only signal driving the output `out1`).

### Fix:
Replace the assignment to `signal2` with `signal1` in the reset clause:

```vhdl
if rst = '1' then
    signal1 <= '0';  -- Corrected: Assign to declared signal1
elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    signal1 <= not signal1;
end if;
```

### Corrected Code:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Only signal1 is needed
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';  -- Fixed assignment
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;
    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

### Why This Works:
- `signal1` is properly declared and used consistently throughout the design.
- The reset correctly initializes `signal1` to `'0'`, ensuring predictable behavior.
- The output `out1` directly follows `signal1`, which now toggles correctly on clock edges when not in reset.

### Key Takeaway:
Always ensure all signals/variables are declared before use. This error typically arises from typos or incomplete refactoring of code. Most HDL tools will explicitly flag undeclared identifiers like this during compilation/synthesis.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
