The error message you're encountering indicates that `signal2` is not declared in your VHDL code. This error occurs because you are trying to assign a value to `signal2` in the process block, but `signal2` has not been declared anywhere in your architecture.

**Root Cause:**
- The VHDL code tries to use `signal2`, but this signal has not been declared in the `architecture` body. Any signal you use in the architecture must be declared before it can be used.

**Fix:**
- Declare `signal2` as a signal within your `architecture` body. You can declare it similar to how `signal1` is declared. Here is how you can fix it:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top8 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    signal signal2 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Declare signal2 here
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal2 <= '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            signal1 <= not signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1; 
end Behavioral;
```

By adding `signal2` to the declarations within the architecture, you resolve the error indicating that `signal2` is not declared.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

2.2.3 Signal Declarations
A signal that is used for internal connections within a system is declared within the module before its
ﬁrst use. Each signal must be declared by listing its type followed by a user-deﬁned name. Signal names
of like type can be declared on the same line separated with a comma. All of the legal data types
described above can be used for signals; however, only types net, reg, and integer will synthesize...
