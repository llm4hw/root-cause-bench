The bug in the provided code is caused by a width mismatch in the assignment statement `output <= input1;`. 

The `output` signal is defined as a `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)` which has 4 bits, while the `input1` signal is defined as `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)` which has only 3 bits. This results in a width mismatch error during synthesis.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the assignment between `output` and `input1` has matching widths. You can either change the width of `input1` to be `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)` to match `output`, or modify the assignment logic to properly handle the width difference. 

By making sure that both signals have the same width, you can eliminate the width mismatch error and allow for proper synthesis and simulation of the design.
