The error message indicates a width mismatch in the assignment statement: `output <= input1;`. In VHDL, when you're assigning one signal to another, both signals must have the same width (number of bits). 

In the provided code, `input1` is defined as a `std_logic_vector` with 3 bits (from 2 downto 0), while `output` is defined to have 4 bits (from 3 downto 0). This discrepancy in width is the reason for the error message.

During assignment, VHDL requires that the width of the source (right side of the assignment) matches the width of the target (left side of the assignment). Here, the source (`input1`) has only 3 bits while the target (`output`) expects 4 bits, leading to the width mismatch error reported during simulation or synthesis.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that both vectors have the same width. This can be achieved by modifying either the definition of `input1` to have 4 bits, or by ensuring that `output` can accommodate (or properly utilize) the 3-bit input through appropriate modification or padding in the assignment statement.
