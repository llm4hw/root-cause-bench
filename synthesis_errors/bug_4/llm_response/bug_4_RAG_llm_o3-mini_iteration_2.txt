The error message indicates that there is a width mismatch when trying to assign the 3-bit vector (input1) to a 4-bit vector (output). In the assignment:

  output <= input1;

the target output is 4 bits wide (declared as STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)) while the source input1 is only 3 bits wide (declared as STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(2 downto 0)). This is why the test bench (or synthesis tool) is complaining.

To fix the issue, you need to ensure that both sides have matching widths. You can either:

1. Change the declaration of output to be 3 bits wide, if that is what’s intended.
  For example:
   output : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(2 downto 0);

or

2. Extend the input vector to 4 bits when assigning to output. For example, you can concatenate an extra bit (e.g., a '0' or '1') to the input:
  output <= '0' & input1;

This way, the concatenated result is a 4-bit vector matching the output's specification.

The bug is occurring because VHDL requires the number of bits in the source and target of an assignment to be equal, and the mismatch causes a width error detected during simulation (or synthesis).
