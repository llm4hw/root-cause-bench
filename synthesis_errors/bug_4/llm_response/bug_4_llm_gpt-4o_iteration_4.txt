The error message indicates a width mismatch problem in your VHDL code. Specifically, the signal `output` is a 4-bit wide `std_logic_vector`, whereas `input1` is a 3-bit wide `std_logic_vector`. The assignment `output <= input1;` tries to assign a 3-bit vector to a 4-bit vector, which doesn't match in size and hence causes the synthesis error.

Here's why this is happening:

1. **Definition of Widths**: In VHDL, each signal must have a compatible size for direct assignment. Your signal `input1` is defined as `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)`, which gives it a width of 3 bits, while `output` is defined as `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`, which gives it a width of 4 bits.

2. **Width Mismatch**: During the assignment `output <= input1;`, VHDL requires that the number of bits on both sides of the assignment operator (`<=`) must be the same or compatible through some deterministic logic. Here, the left and right sides have differing bit widths (4 and 3 respectively), leading to the width mismatch error.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the bit widths match during the assignment. Since you have requested not to provide a specific code solution, generally, here are the ways this can be handled:

- **Concatenation**: You can modify the assignment such that both the `output` and `input1` signals have compatible widths. This might involve concatenating a constant or another signal to `input1` to make it 4 bits wide before assignment.

- **Modification of Signal Widths**: Another approach is to change either the width of the `output` signal or redefine the width of the `input1` signal, depending on the design requirement.

In summary, the root cause of the issue is a width mismatch during an assignment, which needs addressing by ensuring compatible bit widths between the source and target in the assignment statement.
