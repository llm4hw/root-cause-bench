The error message "width mismatch in assignment; target has 4 bits, source has 3 bits" indicates that there is a problem with the assignment statement where the number of bits, or the width, of the source signal differs from that of the target signal. 

In the VHDL code provided:
- The signal `input1` is declared as a 3-bit `std_logic_vector` (2 downto 0).
- The signal `output` is declared as a 4-bit `std_logic_vector` (3 downto 0).

The assignment `output <= input1;` tries to assign the 3-bit vector `input1` to the 4-bit vector `output`. This causes a width mismatch because VHDL expects the source and target widths in an assignment to match exactly.

This error occurs because the size of the vectors on both sides of the assignment operator `<=` are different, leading to an inability to directly assign one to the other without some additional logic or manipulation to handle the discrepancy.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that both `input1` and `output` have the same width in their declarations, or correctly manage the difference in widths during the assignment. You might consider one of the following strategies, depending on the intended design behavior:
1. Adjust the declaration of `output` to be a 3-bit vector if you only need 3 bits.
2. Adjust the declaration of `input1` to be a 4-bit vector if you need to use 4 bits.
3. Modify the assignment to properly handle the conversion between a 3-bit and a 4-bit vector by deciding on the appropriate padding (e.g., adding a leading zero or sign-extension).

However, without changing the code yourself, these approaches outline how to address the difference in bit width properly.
