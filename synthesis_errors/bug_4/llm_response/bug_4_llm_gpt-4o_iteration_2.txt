The error you're encountering is a width mismatch error in your VHDL code. Specifically, the problem arises because you are trying to assign a 3-bit wide signal `input1` to a 4-bit wide signal `output`. This mismatch in bit width leads to the synthesis tool generating the error.

In VHDL, when you have an assignment with mismatched widths between the source and the destination, the synthesis tool expects the bit widths to be the same for successful assignment. In this case:

- `input1` is defined as a 3-bit wide `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)`.
- `output` is defined as a 4-bit wide `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`.

The error is occurring because there is an attempt to directly assign `input1` to `output`, which is not permissible due to their differing widths.

To address this issue, you need to correct the width mismatch. This could involve one of the following:

1. **Adjusting the Widths**: Modify the bit width of either `input1` or `output` so that both have matching widths. This will depend on the intended design functionality. If `output` should indeed have 4 bits, you would need to appropriately extend `input1` to match this width.

2. **Controlled Extension**: If you need to extend `input1` to match the 4-bit `output`, you can prepend a bit to `input1`. Commonly, a `'0'` is added to achieve this, but it depends on the intended behavior of your module.

The resolution should match your design intent, ensuring that the assignment complies with whatever logic you intend to implement in the module.
