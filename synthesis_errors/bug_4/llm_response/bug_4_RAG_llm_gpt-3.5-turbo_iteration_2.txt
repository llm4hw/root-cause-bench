The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-690] width mismatch in assignment; target has 4 bits, source has 3 bits" indicates that there is an issue with the assignment of signals in your Verilog code.

In your code snippet, the problem stems from trying to assign a `std_logic_vector` signal `input1` (which is 3 bits wide) to another `std_logic_vector` signal `output` (which is 4 bits wide) at line 41: `output <= input1;`.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that you are assigning signals of compatible widths. You can correct this by either changing the width of `input1` to match the width of `output`, or by adjusting the width of `output` to match `input1`. 

For example, if you want to make `output` the same width as `input1`, you can change the declaration of `output` to `out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(2 downto 0));`.

Making this adjustment ensures that the assignment is between signals of the same width, resolving the width mismatch error.
