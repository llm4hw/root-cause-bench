### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because of a **width mismatch** in the assignment `output <= input1;`. Here's why:

1. **Signal Widths**:
   - `input1` is declared as `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)` (3 bits).
   - `output` is declared as `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)` (4 bits).

2. **Assignment Issue**:
   - The assignment attempts to directly connect a 3-bit signal (`input1`) to a 4-bit port (`output`). 
   - VHDL requires both sides of an assignment to have identical bit widths for direct assignment. 

3. **Synthesis Failure**:
   - Synthesis tools cannot infer how to handle the extra bit in `output`. Should it be:
     - Tied to `'0'` or `'1'` (zero/sign extension)?
     - Connected to a specific bit of `input1`?
     - Left unconnected?
   - This ambiguity triggers the width mismatch error during synthesis.

### Root Cause:
The fundamental issue is **inconsistent port sizing** in the entity declaration. The design assumes `input1` and `output` have the same width, but their vector declarations differ:
- `input1`: 3 bits (`2 downto 0`)
- `output`: 4 bits (`3 downto 0`)

### Fix Required:
Resolve the width mismatch by **explicitly mapping the bit widths**. Options include:
1. **Zero/Sign Extension** (e.g., assign `output(3)` separately and map `output(2 downto 0) <= input1`).
2. **Port Redesign**:
   - Modify `input1` to 4 bits, or
   - Modify `output` to 3 bits, or
   - Add logic to handle the width conversion.

### Key Insight:
VHDL does **not** implicitly resize vectors. You must explicitly define how to handle mismatched widths in assignments. The fix depends on the intended functionality (e.g., padding, truncation, or error correction).
