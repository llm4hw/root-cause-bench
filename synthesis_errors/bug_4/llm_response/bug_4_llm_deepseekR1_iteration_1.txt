### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs due to a **bit-width mismatch** in the assignment `output <= input1;`:
1. **Target width (`output`)**: Declared as `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)` (4 bits).
2. **Source width (`input1`)**: Declared as `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(2 downto 0)` (3 bits).

VHDL requires strict matching of vector widths in direct assignments. Here, you're attempting to assign a 3-bit vector to a 4-bit vector, violating this rule.

### Why the Error Occurs:
During synthesis, the tool detects this width incompatibility and halts with:
> `[Synth 8-690] width mismatch in assignment; target has 4 bits, source has 3 bits`

### How to Fix:
**Adjust the bit widths to match** using one of these approaches:
1. **Extend `input1`** to 4 bits by:
   - Zero-extending: `'0' & input1`
   - Sign-extending: `input1(2) & input1` (replicates MSB)
2. **Resize the ports**:
   - Change `output` to 3 bits (`STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(2 downto 0)`) if design intent permits
   - Change `input1` to 4 bits if additional input bits are available
3. **Partial assignment**:
   Assign `input1` to a subset of `output` (e.g., `output(2 downto 0) <= input1;`) and explicitly set the remaining bit (e.g., `output(3) <= '0';`).

### Root Cause:
The fundamental issue is a **port declaration inconsistency** between the entity's input and output vector sizes. The assignment violates VHDL's strict type-checking rules for vector widths.
