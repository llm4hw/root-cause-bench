The error message you are encountering is due to a width mismatch between the `output` and `input1` signals in your VHDL code. Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to fix it:

### Bug Explanation:
- **Width Mismatch**: The signal `input1` is declared as `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)`, which means it has 3 bits. Meanwhile, the `output` signal is declared as `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`, which implies 4 bits.
- **Assignment Issue**: When you are trying to assign `input1` to `output` using `output <= input1;`, their widths don't match (3 bits vs. 4 bits), leading to the "width mismatch in assignment" error during synthesis.

### How to Fix it:
To fix this error, you need to ensure that both the `input1` and `output` signals have the same bit width or appropriately handle the different widths. Here are two possible approaches:

1. **Adjust Signal Widths to Match**:
    - If the logic design allows, change the definition of `output` to have 3 bits instead of 4, like this:
    ```vhdl
    entity top4 is
        Port ( input1 : in  std_logic_vector(2 downto 0);
               output : out std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)); -- Change this to 2 downto 0
    end top4;
    ```

2. **Sign Extension (if 4-bit output is required)**:
    - If the 4-bit `output` is required for other parts of your design, you can extend `input1` to match its width by concatenating an extra bit, typically a '0', to the most significant position (MSB):
    ```vhdl
    architecture Behavioral of top4 is
    begin
        output <= '0' & input1; -- Prepend a '0' to the 3-bit input1 to make it 4 bits
    end Behavioral;
    ```
   - This method assumes that extending `input1` with a '0' makes logical sense for your design's requirements.

Choose the solution that best fits your design goals. If it's simply a matter of matching bit widths without altering design intent, adjusting the signal widths can be appropriate. If specific design needs dictate a 4-bit output, extending `input1` is the way to go.
