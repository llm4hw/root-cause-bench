The error message "width mismatch in assignment; target has 4 bits, source has 3 bits" indicates that there is a width mismatch problem in your VHDL code. Specifically, this issue occurs because you are trying to assign a 3-bit signal (`input1`) to a 4-bit signal (`output`).

Root Cause:
- `input1` is declared as a 3-bit wide `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)`.
- `output` is declared as a 4-bit wide `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`.
  
Since the widths do not match, the simulation tool generates this error.

Fix:
To resolve this error, you need to ensure that both the input and output signals have the same width. There are a couple of ways to fix this, depending on the requirements:

1. **Extend the width of `input1` to 4 bits:**
   You can modify the declaration of `input1` to be 4 bits wide by changing it to `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)` to match the width of `output`.

   ```vhdl
   Port ( input1 : in  std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
          output : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0));
   ```

2. **Truncate or pad the width of `output`:**
   If you need to keep `input1` as 3 bits, you can adjust the assignment to accommodate this:

   If you want to zero-extend `input1` to match `output`, you can pad it with a zero bit:

   ```vhdl
   output <= '0' & input1; 
   ```

   This adds a leading zero to `input1`, making it 4 bits wide before assigning it to `output`.

Consider what suits your design requirements the best and apply the appropriate fix.
