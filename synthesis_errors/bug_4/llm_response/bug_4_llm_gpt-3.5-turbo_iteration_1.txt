The error is occurring because there is a width mismatch in the assignment statement in the architecture of the `top4` module. In the provided code, the output port `output` is declared as a `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)` which has 4 bits, while the input port `input1` is declared as a `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)` with 3 bits, hence, the width mismatch in the assignment `output <= input1`.

To fix this error, you need to ensure that the width of the input port matches the width of the output port in the assignment statement. This can be done by adjusting the width of either the input or output port so that they match (either changing `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)` to `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)` or vice versa) to resolve the width mismatch issue.
