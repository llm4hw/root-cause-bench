The bug arises due to a **width mismatch** in the signal assignment. Here's why:

1. **Signal Width Discrepancy**:
   - `input1` is declared as `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)` (3 bits)
   - `output` is declared as `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)` (4 bits)

2. **Assignment Issue**:
   - The line `output <= input1` attempts to assign a 3-bit signal to a 4-bit signal
   - VHDL requires strict matching of vector lengths in direct assignments
   - The synthesis tool detects that the source (3 bits) and target (4 bits) have different sizes

3. **Simulation/Synthesis Failure**:
   - The error occurs because the tool cannot automatically determine how to handle the missing bit
   - No implicit resizing or padding exists for `std_logic_vector` assignments in VHDL
   - The test bench would fail when driving/checking the full 4-bit output

**Fix Direction**:
Explicitly resolve the width mismatch by:
- Expanding `input1` to 4 bits using concatenation (e.g., adding a `'0'` or `'1'` MSB/LSB)
- Adjusting port declarations to matching widths if design requirements allow
- Using explicit type conversion with padding logic

The core issue is the **incompatible vector sizes in a direct assignment**, violating VHDL's strong typing rules for array signals.
