### Bug Analysis
The error occurs due to a **bit-width mismatch** in the assignment `output <= input1;`:
- `input1` is declared as `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)` (3 bits)
- `output` is declared as `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)` (4 bits)

VHDL requires strict matching of bit widths in assignments. Here, you're trying to assign a 3-bit vector to a 4-bit vector, which violates this rule.

---

### Fix
**Option 1 (Recommended): Zero-extend the input**  
Modify the assignment to pad the MSB with a `'0'`:
```vhdl
output <= '0' & input1;  -- MSB=0, LSB=input1
```
This creates a 4-bit output:  
- `output(3) = '0'`  
- `output(2 downto 0) = input1`

**Option 2: Resize the ports**  
If design requirements allow, change the port declarations to match widths:
```vhdl
entity top4 is
    Port ( input1 : in  std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);  -- 4-bit input
           output : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)); -- 4-bit output
```

---

### Corrected Code
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top4 is
begin
    output <= '0' & input1;  -- Fixed assignment
end Behavioral;
```

### Why This Fix Works
- Concatenation (`'0' & input1`) explicitly creates a 4-bit value by adding a leading zero to the 3-bit input.
- All bits in the 4-bit `output` are now properly assigned, resolving the width mismatch.

> ⚠️ **Note**: If sign-extension is needed (e.g., for signed arithmetic), use `output <= input1(input1'high) & input1;` instead. However, for simple bit matching, zero-extension is safer.
