The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-690] width mismatch in assignment; target has 4 bits, source has 3 bits" is indicating a width mismatch in the assignment of signals. In your code, `output` is declared as a `STD_LOGIC_VECTOR` with a width of 4 bits (`3 downto 0`), but you are trying to directly assign `input1`, which is a `std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)` with a width of 3 bits. 

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the widths of the signals match before making the assignment. You can do this by either extending the width of `input1` to match the width of `output`, or by assigning a subset of `input1` to `output` by explicitly selecting the desired bits.

Here is the modified code where `input1` is extended to match the width of `output` before the assignment:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top4 is
begin
    output <= input1 & '0';  -- Extending input1 with a '0' to match the width of output
end Behavioral;
```

Alternatively, if you only want to assign bits 2-0 of `input1` to `output`, you can do this:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top4 is
begin
    output <= input1 & input1(2);  -- Assigning input1(2 downto 0) to output
end Behavioral;
```

By making these modifications, you ensure that the widths of the signals match, resolving the width mismatch error.
