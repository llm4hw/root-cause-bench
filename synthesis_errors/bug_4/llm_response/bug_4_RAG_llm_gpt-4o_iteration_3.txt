The error message you're encountering is due to a width mismatch between the `input1` and `output` signals. The issue arises because you are trying to assign `input1`, which is a 3-bit wide vector (`std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)`), to `output`, which is defined as a 4-bit wide vector (`STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)`).

**Root Cause:**
- `input1` is 3 bits wide.
- `output` is 4 bits wide.
- Directly assigning a 3-bit vector to a 4-bit vector without any modification causes a width mismatch.

**Fix:**
To resolve this issue, you need to match the width of both vectors. You can do this by extending the `input1` vector to match the width of the `output` vector. Below are a few methods to achieve this, depending on the desired behavior:

1. **Zero Padding:** Add a leading zero to the `input1` to make it 4 bits.
   ```vhdl
   output <= "0" & input1;
   ```

2. **Sign Extension:** If `input1` represents a signed value and you want sign extension.
   ```vhdl
   output <= (others => input1(2)) & input1;  -- Sign extension
   ```

3. **Specific Bit Padding:** If you need to pad with specific bits or pattern.
   ```vhdl
   output <= "1" & input1;  -- In case you need to pad with '1'
   ```

Choose the option that best suits the intended operation of the design. Using option one (`"0" & input1`) is common if you're dealing with unsigned data and just want to pad with zeros to extend the width.
