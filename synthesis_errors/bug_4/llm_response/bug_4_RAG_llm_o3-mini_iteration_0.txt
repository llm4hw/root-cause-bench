The error is due to a width mismatch between the source signal and the target signal in the assignment. In your VHDL code, input1 is defined as a 3-bit vector (std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)) while output is a 4-bit vector (STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0)). The assignment

  output <= input1; 

tries to assign a 3-bit value to a 4-bit signal, which is not allowed because the signal widths do not match.

To fix this, you need to match the widths. You have two options:

1. Change the output port to be 3 bits instead of 4 bits if that matches your design requirements.
2. Modify the assignment to extend the 3-bit input to 4 bits. For example, you could concatenate an extra bit (such as a '0') to the input like this:

  output <= '0' & input1;

This concatenates a '0' to the MSB side, creating a 4-bit value.

Choose the option that best fits your design goals. The error occurred during simulation because the test bench or simulator checks for such mismatches, and the tools require that the source and target signal widths exactly match.

Design a Verilog model to implement the

to instantiate the gate-level primitives just like a
traditional subsystem; however, you don’t need
to create the gate-level modules as they are
already built into the Verilog standard. You will
