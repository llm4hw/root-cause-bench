The error occurs because you are trying to assign a 3-bit vector (input1) to a 4-bit output. In other words, your target (output) is declared as a 4-bit std_logic_vector (3 downto 0), while your source (input1) is declared as a 3-bit vector (2 downto 0). This width mismatch causes the simulator (and synthesis tools) to flag an error.

Why It Happens:
• When the simulator or synthesis tool checks the assignment, it detects that the widths are not the same.
• Since output is 4 bits wide but input1 is only 3 bits wide, the assignment is not compatible.

How to Fix It:
You have a couple of options depending on your design intent:

1. Adjust the Port Widths:
   • If your design should have a 3-bit output, then change the port declaration for output to std_logic_vector(2 downto 0), matching input1.
   • Alternatively, if input1 is meant to be 4 bits, change its definition to std_logic_vector(3 downto 0).

2. Extend the 3-Bit Input to 4 Bits:
   • If the design requires a 4-bit output and input1 is intentionally 3 bits, you can extend the input1 to 4 bits by concatenating an extra bit. For example, if you want to pad a zero in the MSB, you can modify your assignment as follows:
     
     output <= "0" & input1;
     
   • This concatenation adds a zero at the beginning of input1, resulting in a 4-bit vector, which matches the output's width.

By making one of these changes, the width mismatch will be resolved, and the simulation error will be eliminated.
