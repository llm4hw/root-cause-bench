### Bug Analysis
The error occurs due to a **bit-width mismatch** in the assignment `output <= input1`:
- `input1` is declared as a 3-bit vector (`std_logic_vector(2 downto 0)`)
- `output` is declared as a 4-bit vector (`std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`)
- VHDL requires both sides of an assignment to have identical bit widths.

### Why This Error Occurs
1. **Synthesis/Simulation Rule**: VHDL strictly enforces matching bit widths for signal assignments.
2. **Type Safety**: The compiler detects that you're trying to fit a 3-bit value into a 4-bit destination without explicit handling of the extra bit.
3. **Error Context**: The synthesis tool ([Synth 8-690]) flags this during compilation because it cannot infer how to handle the size difference.

### Fix
**Option 1: Zero-Extend the Input**  
Add a leading '0' to `input1` to match the 4-bit width:
```vhdl
output <= '0' & input1;  -- MSB=0, LSBs=input1
```

**Option 2: Change Port Widths**  
Modify the entity declaration to make widths consistent (if design allows):
```vhdl
entity top4 is
    Port ( input1 : in  std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);  -- Change to 4-bit input
           output : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 downto 0));
end top4;
```

### Fixed Code
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top4 is
begin
    output <= '0' & input1;  -- Fixed assignment (zero-extended)
end Behavioral;
```

### Why This Fix Works
- `'0' & input1` concatenates a leading zero to the 3-bit `input1`, creating a 4-bit value.
- Bit alignment:  
  - `output(3) = '0'`  
  - `output(2 downto 0) = input1(2 downto 0)`  
- Eliminates the width mismatch while preserving the original input values in the LSBs.

### Key Takeaway
Always ensure **bit-width consistency** in assignments. When widths differ, explicitly handle the extra bits using:
- Concatenation (`&`)
- Bit-slicing (e.g., `output(2 downto 0) <= input1`)
- Resize functions (for numeric types)
