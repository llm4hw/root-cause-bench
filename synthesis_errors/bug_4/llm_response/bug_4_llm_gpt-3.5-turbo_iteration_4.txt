The error message indicates a width mismatch in the assignment of the signal 'input1' to the signal 'output'. The target signal 'output' is defined as STD_LOGIC_VECTOR with a range of 3 downto 0, while the source signal 'input1' is defined as std_logic_vector with a range of 2 downto 0. 

The root cause of this issue is that the sizes of the two vectors do not match during the assignment operation. In this case, the target signal 'output' has 4 bits while the source signal 'input1' has only 3 bits. This inconsistency in the sizes of the signals is causing the error.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the size of the target signal 'output' matches the size of the source signal 'input1' during the assignment. You can either change the range of 'output' to match the size of 'input1', or you can perform an operation to truncate or extend the 'input1' signal to match the size of 'output'.
