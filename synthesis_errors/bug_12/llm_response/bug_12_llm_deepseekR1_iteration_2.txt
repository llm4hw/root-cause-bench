The error occurs because a `std_logic` signal is being incorrectly initialized with a string literal. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Problematic Line**:
   ```vhdl
   signal a : std_logic := "0";
   ```
   - `a` is declared as `std_logic` (single-bit type)
   - `"0"` is a string literal (multi-character sequence enclosed in double quotes)

2. **Type Mismatch**:
   - `std_logic` requires a **single-character literal** (e.g., `'0'`)
   - String literals like `"0"` are for multi-bit types like `std_logic_vector`

3. **Why the Error Points to `end entity`**:
   Synthesis tools often report errors at later lines (like `end entity`) when they finish processing the entire declaration block and detect inconsistencies in earlier definitions.

4. **Secondary Issue**:
   The signal `c` uses correct initialization (`"0000"` is valid for `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`), highlighting that the problem is isolated to the `std_logic` assignment.

**Fix Required**:
Replace the double-quoted string `"0"` with a single-quoted character `'0'` for the `std_logic` signal initialization. The tool expects a character literal for single-bit types.
