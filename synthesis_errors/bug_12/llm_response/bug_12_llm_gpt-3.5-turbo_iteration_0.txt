The error message is indicating a type mismatch between `std_logic` and a string literal in line 41 of the VHDL code. The issue is with the assignment of `"0"` to signal `a`, which is declared as type `std_logic`. In VHDL, you cannot directly assign a string literal (e.g., `"0"`) to a `std_logic` type.

To fix this issue, you can assign a specific value compatible with `std_logic` type to signal `a`. For example, you can use `std_logic '0'` for logic 0 or `std_logic '1'` for logic 1. 

After making this correction, the code should simulate without errors.
