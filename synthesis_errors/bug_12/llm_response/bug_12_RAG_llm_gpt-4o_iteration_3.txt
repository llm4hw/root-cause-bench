The error message indicates that there is a type mismatch between a `std_logic` type and a string literal in your VHDL code. This error occurs because you are trying to assign a string literal (in this case, a binary string) to a `std_logic` signal, which only accepts single character literals ('0' or '1').

In the provided code, the issue lies in this line:

```vhdl
signal a : std_logic := "0";
```

Here, `"0"` is a string literal, but `a` is declared as a `std_logic`, which should be assigned a single character literal.

To fix this error, change the assignment from a string literal to a single character literal:

```vhdl
signal a : std_logic := '0';
```

After applying this change, the `a` signal is correctly initialized to a single `std_logic` value, and this should resolve the type mismatch error during synthesis or simulation.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., ‚Äú0000,‚Äù ‚Äú0001,‚Äù
‚Äú0010,‚Äù . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
