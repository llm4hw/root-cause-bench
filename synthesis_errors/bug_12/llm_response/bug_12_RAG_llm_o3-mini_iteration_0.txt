The bug is in the initialization of the signal "a". In VHDL, a signal of type std_logic should be initialized with a single character literal using single quotes (e.g., '0') rather than a string literal using double quotes (e.g., "0"). In your code, you have written:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉsignal a : std_logic := "0";

This is causing a type mismatch because "0" is interpreted as a string, which does not match the std_logic type. Although the error message points to "end entity;" due to the way the compiler reports errors, the real issue is the incorrect initialization on the signal declaration.

To fix the bug, change the initialization to use single quotes like this:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉsignal a : std_logic := '0';

This will properly assign the value to a as a std_logic constant, resolving the type mismatch error.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., ‚Äú0000,‚Äù ‚Äú0001,‚Äù
‚Äú0010,‚Äù . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
