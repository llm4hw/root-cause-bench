The error message you're encountering, "type std_logic does not match with a string literal," indicates that there is a type mismatch in your VHDL code. This mismatch arises because a string literal is being assigned to a `std_logic` type, which is not compatible.

The issue stems specifically from these lines of your code:

```vhdl
signal a : std_logic := "0";
signal c : std_logic_vector (3 downto 0) := "0000";
```

1. **Assignment to `std_logic`:**
   - The signal `a` is defined as a `std_logic`, which is a single-bit signal. However, it's being initialized with the string `"0"`. In VHDL, when dealing with `std_logic`, you should use character literals (single quotes), not string literals. Therefore, it should be `'0'` instead of `"0"`.
   
2. **Assignment to `std_logic_vector`:**
   - Similarly, `c` is a `std_logic_vector` of 4 bits, and you are assigning it a string `"0000"`. While this assignment seems correct at first glance, the issue lies in misidentification of signal types in conjunction with string literals within the VHDL type system or the correctness of the length assigned.

The error you reported is flagged by the simulation or toolchain, reflecting a misunderstanding of how literals should be represented. The character literals should be used for single bit `std_logic`, while the string literals should be used for `std_logic_vector`, provided the length matches.

**Why the bug occurs:**
- The VHDL synthesis and simulation tools expect that `std_logic` should be initialized using character literals as single-bit values are distinct from strings, even single character strings, in this context.

**Summary:**
- Ensure that `std_logic` type uses character literals to initialize, i.e., `'0'` rather than `"0"`.

Fix this by changing the initialization of `a` to use a character literal:
```vhdl
signal a : std_logic := '0';
```

This respects the correct type assignments, which should remove the error generated by this mismatch. For `c`, as it meets the condition without further mismatches observed, its initialization does appear consistent once literal mismatch understanding is corrected for the single-bit case.
