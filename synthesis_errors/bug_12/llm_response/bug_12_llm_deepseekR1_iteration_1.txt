The error occurs due to a type mismatch in the signal initialization within the VHDL architecture. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Problem Location**:  
   The issue is in the signal declaration:  
   `signal a : std_logic := "0";`  
   The error message points to line 41 (`end entity;`) because the compiler's error reporting sometimes flags the end of the entity declaration when it detects an unresolved type conflict earlier in the code.

2. **Core Issue**:  
   - `std_logic` is a **single-bit** type (scalar)  
   - `"0"` is a **string literal** (array type, length=1)  
   VHDL requires strict type matching: scalar types like `std_logic` must be assigned character literals (`' '`), not string literals (`" "`).

3. **Why the Error Occurs**:  
   The compiler expects a character literal (`'0'`) for `std_logic` initialization but finds a string literal (`"0"`). This type mismatch violates VHDL's strong typing rules, causing the synthesis error.

4. **Secondary Issue**:  
   The signal `c` uses correct initialization (`"0000"` matches the `std_logic_vector` type), confirming that the problem is isolated to scalar (`std_logic`) assignments.

5. **Root Cause**:  
   VHDL distinguishes between:  
   - Character literals (single quotes) for scalar types like `std_logic`  
   - String literals (double quotes) for array types like `std_logic_vector`  

**Fix Required**:  
Replace the string literal `"0"` with a character literal `'0'` in the initialization of signal `a`. No other changes are needed. The testbench error will resolve once the scalar type receives the correct literal format.
