The error is due to the initialization of the signal "a". In VHDL, a signal of type std_logic expects a single-bit literal enclosed in single quotes, not a string literal with double quotes. The code mistakenly initializes "a" with "0" (a string literal) instead of '0' (a character literal). This type mismatch causes the synthesis tool to complain that a std_logic type does not match with a string literal.

The fix would be to change the initialization of signal "a" so that it uses a character literal. This would remove the type mismatch error.
