The error message indicates a type mismatch between the std_logic data type and a string literal in the VHDL code. Specifically, the error occurs in line 41 of the code where the entity declaration is ended.

The bug in this code is that the signals 'a' and 'c' are being initialized with string literals ("0" and "0000" respectively) instead of std_logic values. In VHDL, signals of type std_logic cannot be directly initialized with string literals. 

To fix this issue, the string literal should be replaced with the appropriate std_logic value. In this case, the signal 'a' should be initialized as '0', and the signal 'c' should be initialized as (others => '0'), which represents a std_logic_vector of all '0's.

After making these changes, the code should no longer have a type mismatch error between std_logic and string literal during synthesis.
