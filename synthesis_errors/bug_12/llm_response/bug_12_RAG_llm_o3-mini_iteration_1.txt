The bug is that the code assigns a string literal ("0") to a signal declared as a scalar std_logic. In VHDL, a std_logic scalar must be initialized with a character literal using single quotes (e.g., '0'), not with a string literal (e.g., "0") which is meant for std_logic_vector types. Because of this type mismatch, the synthesis tool reports that a std_logic does not match with a string literal.

To fix the error, change the initialization of signal a from

  signal a : std_logic := "0";

to

  signal a : std_logic := '0';

This makes the literal match the std_logic type and should resolve the error.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
