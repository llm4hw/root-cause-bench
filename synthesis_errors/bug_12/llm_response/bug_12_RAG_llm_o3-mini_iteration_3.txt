The bug is due to the signal "a" (of type std_logic) being initialized with a string literal ("0") instead of a character literal ('0'). In VHDL, a std_logic value must be assigned using a single quote (e.g., '0') because double quotes denote a string (or a vector literal), which is not compatible with a single bit type.

Why It Occurs:
‚Ä¢ The error message indicates a type mismatch: a std_logic is being compared to or initialized with a string literal.
‚Ä¢ The declaration "signal a : std_logic := "0";" uses double quotes, which is only valid for std_logic_vector types, not for a single std_logic.

How to Fix It:
‚Ä¢ Change the initialization for "a" from "0" (string literal) to '0' (character literal), like so:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉsignal a : std_logic := '0';

This change will resolve the type mismatch error and allow the simulation (or synthesis, if applicable) to proceed without that error.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., ‚Äú0000,‚Äù ‚Äú0001,‚Äù
‚Äú0010,‚Äù . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
