The error message indicates that there is an issue with the assignment of a string literal to a signal of type `std_logic`. Here's a breakdown of the cause of the issue and how to fix it:

### Cause of the Error:

- **Signal Initialization**: In VHDL, the `std_logic` type is a single-bit type and should not be initialized with a string. The line `signal a : std_logic := "0";` incorrectly uses a string literal to initialize a single bit type. Similarly, `std_logic_vector` should not be initialized with double quotes.

### Fix:

- **Correct Initialization**: To fix this, you should change the initialization of `signal a` from a string literal `"0"` to a character `'0'`, as `std_logic` expects a single character rather than a string. Similarly, initialize `signal c` with a correct `std_logic_vector` literal using single quotes for each bit.

Here's how you can fix the code:

```vhdl
architecture singal_bit of top12 is
    signal a : std_logic := '0'; -- Correctly using single quotes for std_logic
    signal c : std_logic_vector (3 downto 0) := "0000"; -- This is okay since it's a vector
begin
    out1 <= sel and a;
end singal_bit;
```

By making these changes, you will resolve the mismatch error related to the initialization of `std_logic` with a string literal.

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
