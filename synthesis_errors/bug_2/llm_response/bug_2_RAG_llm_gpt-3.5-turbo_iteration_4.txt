The error message indicates that the synthesis tool is unable to find a definition for the operator "+" used in the statement `c <= a + b;`. 

To fix this issue, you can make use of the type conversion functions provided by `numeric_std`. Since you are performing addition on `std_logic_vector` types `a` and `b`, you should use the `unsigned` type for the arithmetic operation. Here's how you can modify the process to resolve the bug:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity top2 is
    Port ( a : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           b : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           c : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0));
end top2;

architecture Behavioral of top2 is
begin
    process (a, b)
    begin
        c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b)); 
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

By converting `a` and `b` to `unsigned` before performing the addition and then converting the result back to `std_logic_vector`, you ensure that the correct arithmetic operation is executed and the error is resolved.

3.1.8 Concatenation Operator
In Verilog, the curly brackets (i.e., {}) are used to concatenate multiple signals. The target of this
operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.
Example:...

// statement group which follows it, which are sel, a and b)

  end
