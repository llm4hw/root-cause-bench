The error message you're encountering is because VHDL doesn't inherently support the "+" operator for the `std_logic_vector` type. The `std_logic_vector` type is not considered an arithmetic data type in VHDL, and hence, the "+" operation is not defined directly for them.

The root cause of the issue is the usage of `std_logic_vector` for arithmetic operations without conversion. The VHDL packages available, like `ieee.numeric_std`, do provide arithmetic operations, but they are defined for the `unsigned` and `signed` types, not for `std_logic_vector`.

To fix the problem, you need to convert your `std_logic_vector` to one of these arithmetic types before performing the operation, and then convert the result back to `std_logic_vector`. Here is how you can adjust your code:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity top2 is
    Port ( a : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           b : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           c : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0));
end top2;

architecture Behavioral of top2 is
begin
    process (a, b)
    begin
        -- Convert std_logic_vector to unsigned, add them, then convert back to std_logic_vector
        c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b));
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

This solution involves:
- Converting `a` and `b` from `std_logic_vector` to `unsigned` using the `unsigned()` function.
- Performing the "+" operation on the `unsigned` types.
- Converting the result back to `std_logic_vector` using `std_logic_vector()`. 

This will allow the synthesis tool to correctly interpret and perform the addition operation.

In Verilog, the curly brackets (i.e., {}) are used to concatenate multiple signals. The target of this
operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.
