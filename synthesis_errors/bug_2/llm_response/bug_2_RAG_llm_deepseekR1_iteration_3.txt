### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because the `+` operator is not defined for `std_logic_vector` types in VHDL. The line `c <= a + b;` attempts to use arithmetic addition directly on `std_logic_vector` signals, which is invalid without proper type conversion.

### Why This Occurs:
1. **Type Mismatch**:  
   VHDL requires explicit type handling for arithmetic operations. The `std_logic_vector` type is strictly for digital logic representation and lacks built-in arithmetic operators.

2. **Missing Conversion**:  
   While `ieee.numeric_std` is included (which provides arithmetic operations), the code fails to convert `std_logic_vector` to numeric types (`unsigned`/`signed`) before addition.

3. **Synthesis Limitation**:  
   Synthesis tools (like Xilinx Vivado, which generated this error) strictly enforce type rules and cannot infer arithmetic operations on `std_logic_vector` without conversions.

### Fix:
Convert `a` and `b` to `unsigned` before addition, then convert the result back to `std_logic_vector`:

```vhdl
c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b)); 
```

**Fixed Code:**
```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity top2 is
    Port ( a : in  std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           b : in  std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           c : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0));
end top2;

architecture Behavioral of top2 is
begin
    process (a, b)
    begin
        c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b));  -- Fixed line
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

### Key Notes:
- **Unsigned vs. Signed**:  
  Use `unsigned` for binary addition (as in this case). Use `signed` if working with two's complement numbers.
- **Truncation Warning**:  
  Adding two 4-bit numbers produces a 5-bit result. The assignment to 4-bit `c` truncates the carry bit. If overflow handling is needed, expand `c` to 5 bits.
- **Alternative Package**:  
  Avoid non-standard packages like `std_logic_arith`. `numeric_std` is the IEEE-standard solution.

This fix resolves the synthesis error by explicitly handling type conversions for arithmetic operations.

In Verilog, the curly brackets (i.e., {}) are used to concatenate multiple signals. The target of this
operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.

  sum = a + b + ci;

// (the @* token infers sensitivity to any signal read in the statement or
// statement group which follows it, which are sel, a and b)

  end
