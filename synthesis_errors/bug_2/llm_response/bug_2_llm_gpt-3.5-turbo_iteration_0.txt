The error message indicates that there is a problem with the addition operation in your code. In this case, the issue is that you are trying to use the "+" operator directly on std_logic_vector types a and b in the line `c <= a + b;`. 

In VHDL, `+` operator is not directly applicable to `std_logic_vector` types. You need to perform addition using the signed or unsigned types provided by the `numeric_std` library. The error occurs because the compiler cannot find a suitable definition for the operator `+` that operates on `std_logic_vector`.

To fix this bug, you need to convert `std_logic_vector` types a and b to either `signed` or `unsigned` types before performing addition. You can achieve this by using conversion functions like `unsigned()` or `signed()` provided by the `numeric_std` package.

Once you have converted a and b to the appropriate type, you can use the `+` operator to perform addition and assign the result back to c.

By making these changes, you can fix the bug and allow the addition operation to work correctly in your VHDL code.
