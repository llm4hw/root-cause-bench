The error message indicates that there is an issue with the use of the "+" operator for the line `c <= a + b;` in your VHDL code. This problem is occurring because the `+` operator is not directly defined for the `std_logic_vector` type, which is the type of signals `a`, `b`, and `c`.

In VHDL, the `+` operator needs to operate on numerical types. The `std_logic_vector` type, however, is primarily intended for representing an array of bits without any inherent numerical meaning. Therefore, operations involving arithmetic require a conversion to types that have numerical meaning, such as `unsigned` or `signed`, both provided by the `ieee.numeric_std` package.

The reason you're encountering this bug is that while you've included the `ieee.numeric_std` package, which provides overloaded versions of arithmetic operators for `unsigned` and `signed` data types, you have not applied a type conversion to the `std_logic_vector` operands to either `unsigned` or `signed`. Hence, the operator `+` cannot be resolved for two operands of type `std_logic_vector`.

To address and explain this issue, you should:

1. Realize that the `std_logic_vector` type needs conversion to the `unsigned` or `signed` type before performing arithmetic operations.
2. Convert `a` and `b` to `unsigned` (or `signed`, if signed arithmetic is desired) before the addition.
3. Apply a conversion back to `std_logic_vector` for assigning the result to `c`.

Understanding these details allows you to prepare the correct adjustments in your design without copying or using specific code implementations learned from this explanation.
