The error message you are encountering is related to the use of the "+" operator with the `std_logic_vector` type in VHDL. In VHDL, the "+" operator is not directly defined for the `std_logic_vector` type. The `std_logic_vector` type is an array of `std_logic` elements, which are not inherently numerical values. Therefore, the compiler or synthesis tool does not know how to handle the addition operation for these bit arrays directly.

The root cause of the issue is the use of `std_logic_vector` for arithmetic operations without casting or interpreting it as a numerical type. The `numeric_std` package provides functions to convert `std_logic_vector` types to numerical types such as `unsigned` or `signed` which do have a defined "+" operator.

To resolve this issue, you need to explicitly convert `std_logic_vector` to either `unsigned` or `signed` before performing the addition. The `numeric_std` package, which you have already included in your code, provides these conversion functions. After the addition, you will also need to convert the result back to `std_logic_vector` to assign it to `c`.

Here's a summarized explanation of the fix without providing code:
1. Convert both `a` and `b` from `std_logic_vector` to `unsigned`.
2. Perform the addition using the "+" operator defined for `unsigned`.
3. Convert the result from `unsigned` back to `std_logic_vector`.
4. Assign this result to the output `c`.

By following this conversion process, the root cause of the issue will be addressed, and the addition operation will be correctly interpreted and executed by the synthesizer/simulation tool.
