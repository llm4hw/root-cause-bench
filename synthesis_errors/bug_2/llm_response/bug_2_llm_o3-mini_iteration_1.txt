The error occurs because the "+" operator is not defined for std_logic_vector types. In the provided code, a and b are declared as std_logic_vector but the "+" operator, as defined in the IEEE numeric_std package, only works on types such as unsigned or signed. Since a matching operator function for std_logic_vector is not found, the synthesis tool complains.

The bug is essentially a type mismatch: you're attempting to perform arithmetic addition on a type (std_logic_vector) that does not inherently support it in VHDL. The fix involves using a numeric type (such as unsigned) for the operands, or converting the std_logic_vector signals to the proper numeric type before performing the addition.
