The error is due to trying to use the "+" operator on std_logic_vector types. In VHDL, std_logic_vector is just an array of bits and does not have arithmetic semantics. Although you included IEEE.numeric_std (which provides arithmetic for unsigned and signed types), the "+" operator is defined only for those types—not for std_logic_vector.

Why It’s Occurring:
• The line "c <= a + b;" is attempting to add a and b directly, but they are std_logic_vector types.
• There is no definition for operator "+" when its arguments are std_logic_vector.
• This leads the synthesis (and simulation) tools to report that 0 definitions of operator “+” match the operands.

How to Fix It:
Convert the operands to an arithmetic type (typically unsigned or signed) before doing the addition, and then convert the result back to std_logic_vector if needed. For example, if you want to treat the vectors as unsigned numbers, change the assignment to:

  c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b));

This way, unsigned(a) and unsigned(b) are added using the numeric_std-defined operator for unsigned types, and then the result is cast back to std_logic_vector for assignment to c.

By using the necessary type conversion, the synthesis and simulation tools can find the appropriate definition of the "+" operator, and the error is resolved.

In Verilog, the curly brackets (i.e., {}) are used to concatenate multiple signals. The target of this
operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.
