The error you're encountering is due to the use of the "+" operator on `std_logic_vector` types in VHDL without an overloaded operator definition for addition. In VHDL, `std_logic_vector` is an array of bits without an inherent numerical meaning, so arithmetic operations like addition aren't directly supported on them without defining or using an appropriate library that provides such functionality.

**Root cause of the issue:**
In the line `c <= a + b;`, the `+` operation is attempted on `std_logic_vector` types, but `std_logic_vector` does not inherently support arithmetic operations such as addition. This is because `std_logic_vector` is essentially a collection of bits, and without additional context, it has no numerical interpretation.

**How to fix the issue:**
To perform arithmetic operations on `std_logic_vector`, you need to use a library that interprets these vectors as numerical values. The `ieee.numeric_std` library provides such functionality by allowing you to convert `std_logic_vector` to `unsigned` or `signed` types, which can then be used in arithmetic operations.

Here's how you can fix the code:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity top2 is
    Port ( a : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           b : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           c : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0));
end top2;

architecture Behavioral of top2 is
begin
    process (a, b)
    begin
        -- Convert a and b to unsigned integers, perform the addition,
        -- and convert the result back to std_logic_vector
        c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b)); 
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

**Explanation of the fix:**
- `unsigned(a)` and `unsigned(b)` convert the `std_logic_vector` inputs to `unsigned` types.
- The `+` operator is overloaded for `unsigned` types, allowing arithmetic addition.
- `std_logic_vector(...)` then converts the result back to a `std_logic_vector` for assignment to `c`. 

This ensures that addition is correctly interpreted and performed on the input vectors.

operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.
