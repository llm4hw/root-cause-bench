The error occurs because the `+` operator is not directly supported on `std_logic_vector` data types in VHDL. You need to use the `numeric_std` package for arithmetic operations on vector types. To fix this issue, you should include the `numeric_std` package in your code and use the appropriate functions provided by this package for adding two vectors.

Make sure to include the following line at the top of your code after `use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;`:

```vhdl
use ieee.numeric_std.all;
```

Then, replace the line `c <= a + b;` with the correct operation using the `numeric_std` functions, like `c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b));`.

By doing this, you will be able to perform the arithmetic operation on the `std_logic_vector` variables `a` and `b` and assign the result to `c` without encountering the error.
