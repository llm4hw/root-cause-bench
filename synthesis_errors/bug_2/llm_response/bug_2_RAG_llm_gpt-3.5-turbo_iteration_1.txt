The error you are seeing indicates that the synthesis tool is having trouble with the addition operation using the "+" operator in the Verilog code. This is because verilog does not support using the "+" operator directly on `std_logic_vector` types. 

To fix this issue, you can use the `numeric_std` library to perform arithmetic operations on `std_logic_vector` types. Here is how you can update your code:

1. Include the necessary library at the beginning of your code:

```vhdl
use ieee.numeric_std.all;
```

2. Use the `unsigned` type to perform arithmetic on `std_logic_vector`:

```vhdl
entity top2 is
    Port ( a : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           b : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           c : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0));
end top2;

architecture Behavioral of top2 is
begin
    process (a, b)
    begin
        c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b)); 
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

By converting `std_logic_vector` to `unsigned`, performing the arithmetic operation, and then converting the result back to `std_logic_vector`, you can overcome the error and perform the addition operation successfully.

3.1.8 Concatenation Operator
In Verilog, the curly brackets (i.e., {}) are used to concatenate multiple signals. The target of this
operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.
Example:...

- source_documents\verilog_2001_ref_guide.pdf: always @(a, b, ci)
  sum = a + b + ci;

// statement group which follows it, which are sel, a and b)
always @*

    if (sel==0) y = a + b;
    else        y = a * b;
  end
// This example using illustrates several programming statements
