The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `+` operator in the line `c <= a + b;`. The error specifically states that there are no definitions of the `+` operator that match in the context of your code. 

The reason for this error is that the `+` operator is not directly supported on `std_logic_vector` types in synthesizable RTL (Register Transfer Level) code. To perform addition on `std_logic_vector` types, you need to convert them to `unsigned` or `signed` types depending on whether you are working with unsigned or signed numbers. 

To fix this issue, you need to convert the `std_logic_vector` signals `a` and `b` to `unsigned` using the `numeric_std` package, perform the addition operation on them, and then convert the result back to `std_logic_vector` for signal `c`.

Here is the modified code snippet that fixes the issue:
```VHDL
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use ieee.numeric_std.all;

entity top2 is
    Port ( a : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           b : in std_logic_vector(3 downto 0);
           c : out std_logic_vector(3 downto 0));
end top2;

architecture Behavioral of top2 is
begin
    process (a, b)
    begin
        c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b)); 
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

By converting the `std_logic_vector` inputs `a` and `b` to `unsigned`, performing the addition operation, and then converting the result back to `std_logic_vector`, you should be able to fix the error and successfully simulate your design in a tool like ModelSim.

In Verilog, the curly brackets (i.e., {}) are used to concatenate multiple signals. The target of this
operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.
