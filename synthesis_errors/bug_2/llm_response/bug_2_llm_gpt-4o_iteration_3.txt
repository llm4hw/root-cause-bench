The error message indicates a problem with using the "+" operator for the line `c <= a + b;`, specifically that there are "0 definitions" for this operator in this context.

In VHDL, the "+" operator is not directly defined for the `std_logic_vector` type, which is why you are encountering an error. The `std_logic_vector` type is essentially an array of `std_logic` elements and does not inherently represent a numerical value. For numerical operations like addition, you need to use a type that is meant for arithmetic computations. 

The commonly used package `ieee.numeric_std` provides arithmetic functions and operators for `unsigned` and `signed` types, which are intended for numerical operations.

Hereâ€™s why the bug is occurring:
- Your variables `a` and `b` are defined as `std_logic_vector` types.
- The "+" operator is not directly applicable to `std_logic_vector`, as the direction and meaning of the vector isn't automatically interpreted for arithmetic.

To address the issue:
- You should convert `std_logic_vector` types to `unsigned` or `signed` types when you wish to perform arithmetic operations.
- After performing the operation, you might need to convert the result back to `std_logic_vector` to assign it to `c`.

Therefore, the bug is due to a type mismatch for arithmetic operation, and it can be resolved by converting the types appropriately using functions provided by `ieee.numeric_std`. Make sure you perform these conversions carefully, taking bit width and overflow considerations into account.
