The bug is that you are trying to use the "+" operator with std_logic_vector types. In VHDL there is no overloaded definition of "+" for plain std_logic_vector; the arithmetic operators are defined for numeric types such as unsigned or signed (provided by ieee.numeric_std). 

In your code, a and b are defined as std_logic_vector. When you write c <= a + b;, the synthesizer (and simulation) cannot find a matching definition for the "+" operator that takes two std_logic_vectors. 

To fix the issue, you need to convert a and b to a numeric type (typically unsigned) before performing the addition, and then convert the result back to std_logic_vector. For example, you can change the process to:

  process(a, b)
  begin
      c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b));
  end process;

This cast tells the tool to treat a and b as unsigned numbers for the purpose of the addition, which then allows the correct "+" operator to be found and used.

In Verilog, the curly brackets (i.e., {}) are used to concatenate multiple signals. The target of this
operation must be the same size of the sum of the sizes of the input arguments.
