The error message you are encountering, `[Synth 8-944] 0 definitions of operator "+" match here`, is caused by incorrect usage of the `+` operator on `std_logic_vector` types in VHDL. The root cause of the issue is that VHDL does not natively support arithmetic operations directly on `std_logic_vector`. The `std_logic_vector` type is essentially an array of bits and does not inherently have mathematical operations defined for it.

In your code, `a` and `b` are both declared as `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`, and you are trying to add them directly, expecting a result stored in `c`, which is also a `std_logic_vector(3 downto 0)`. However, the `+` operator cannot directly operate on `std_logic_vector` because no arithmetic operations are defined for this data type.

To resolve the issue, you need to convert `std_logic_vector` to `unsigned`, perform the arithmetic operation, and then convert the result back to `std_logic_vector`. This conversion is necessary because the `numeric_std` package provides arithmetic operations such as `+` for the `unsigned` and `signed` types, but not for `std_logic_vector`.

Here's the conceptual understanding of the fix:
1. **Convert** both `a` and `b` from `std_logic_vector` to `unsigned`.
2. **Perform** the addition using the `+` operator, which can be applied to `unsigned` types.
3. **Convert** the result back to `std_logic_vector` before assigning it to `c`.

Understanding this requirement and performing these conversions allows you to use the intended arithmetic operation correctly, resolving the synthesis error.
