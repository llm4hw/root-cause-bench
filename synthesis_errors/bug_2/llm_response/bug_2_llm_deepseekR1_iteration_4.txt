The bug occurs because the `+` operator is not directly defined for `std_logic_vector` types in the VHDL standard libraries being used. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Missing Operator Definition**:
   - The code uses `std_logic_vector` types for inputs `a` and `b`.
   - The `ieee.numeric_std` package provides `+` operators only for `unsigned` and `signed` types, not raw `std_logic_vector`.

2. **Type Mismatch**:
   - When attempting `a + b`, the compiler looks for a `+` operator compatible with `std_logic_vector` operands.
   - Since no such operator exists in `numeric_std` or `std_logic_1164`, the synthesis tool reports "0 definitions of operator '+' match".

3. **Simulation vs Synthesis Discrepancy**:
   - Some simulators automatically load non-standard packages (like `std_logic_unsigned`), which *do* define `+` for `std_logic_vector`.
   - Synthesis tools strictly adhere to explicit dependencies and won't infer missing operators.

**Fix Approach**:
- Explicitly convert `a` and `b` to numeric types (`unsigned` or `signed`) before addition using `numeric_std` functions.
- Convert the result back to `std_logic_vector` for assignment to `c`.
- Example conversion:  
  `c <= std_logic_vector(unsigned(a) + unsigned(b));`

**Critical Note**:  
The output `c` is 4 bits, but adding two 4-bit values may produce a 5-bit result. The conversion must handle potential overflow by either:
- Resizing the result to match `c`'s width, or
- Accepting implicit truncation (which discards the carry bit).
