### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because the `assign` statement is missing a required semicolon (`;`) before the `endmodule` keyword. Verilog requires all statements (including continuous assignments) to be terminated with semicolons.

**Error Breakdown:**
1. **Line in Question:**  
   `assign c = a & b`  
   Missing semicolon at the end.

2. **Why the Error Points to `endmodule`:**  
   The parser expects either:
   - A semicolon to terminate the `assign` statement, or
   - Another statement/module item after `a & b`.  
   When it encounters `endmodule` instead, it flags a syntax error at `endmodule` since this keyword is unexpected at this position in the code.

---

### Fix
Add a semicolon (`;`) to the end of the `assign` statement:

```verilog
module top13(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire c
);
    assign c = a & b;  // ← Semicolon added here
endmodule
```

### Explanation
- **Verilog Syntax Rule:** Every statement (e.g., `assign`, `reg` assignments, `wire` declarations) must end with a semicolon.
- **Compiler Behavior:** The parser reads `assign c = a & b` as an incomplete statement. When `endmodule` follows immediately, it violates the grammar rules, triggering the error at `endmodule`.

### Verification
The corrected code will:
1. Compile without syntax errors.
2. Simulate correctly (output `c = a AND b`).

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a common syntax mistake. Always check for missing semicolons when errors point to `endmodule` or `end` keywords.
