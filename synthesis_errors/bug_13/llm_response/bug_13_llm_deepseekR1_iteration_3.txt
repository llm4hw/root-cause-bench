The error occurs because the continuous assignment statement `assign c = a & b` is missing a terminating semicolon (`;`). Verilog requires all statements within a module to end with a semicolon. 

**Why this causes a syntax error at `endmodule`:**
1. The parser expects a semicolon after the assignment expression
2. When it encounters `endmodule` without seeing the expected semicolon, it interprets this as a syntax error at the `endmodule` keyword
3. The line number points to `endmodule` because that's where the parser realizes the statement wasn't properly terminated

**How to fix:**
Add the missing semicolon at the end of the assignment line:
```verilog
assign c = a & b;
```
This will properly terminate the assignment statement before the `endmodule` declaration. The parser will then recognize `endmodule` as the correct closing construct for the module.
