The error occurs due to a **missing semicolon** at the end of the `assign` statement. Here's why:

1. **The Issue**:  
   The line `assign c = a & b` lacks a terminating semicolon (`;`). Verilog requires every statement to end with a semicolon.

2. **Why the Error Points to `endmodule`**:  
   The parser interprets the `assign` line as incomplete and continues scanning for tokens. When it encounters `endmodule` without a preceding semicolon, it fails to recognize the end of the statement, triggering a syntax error at `endmodule`.

3. **Effect**:  
   The incomplete statement prevents the module from closing properly. The parser expects either:
   - A semicolon to terminate the `assign` statement, or
   - Another valid statement before `endmodule`.

**Fix**:  
Add a semicolon to the assignment line:  
```verilog
assign c = a & b;  // Add semicolon here
```  
This terminates the statement correctly, allowing `endmodule` to be parsed as the end of the module.
