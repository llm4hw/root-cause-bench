The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-2715] syntax error near endmodule" is occurring because of a missing semicolon at the end of the assignment statement in the Verilog module.

In your code, the line `assign c = a & b` is missing a semicolon at the end. This is causing a syntax error because the Verilog compiler expects each statement to end with a semicolon, and it doesn't recognize the `endmodule` keyword correctly due to the syntax error.

Here is the corrected code:

```verilog
module top13(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire c
);

    assign c = a & b; // Added semicolon here

endmodule
```

Adding a semicolon at the end of the `assign` statement should resolve the syntax error.
