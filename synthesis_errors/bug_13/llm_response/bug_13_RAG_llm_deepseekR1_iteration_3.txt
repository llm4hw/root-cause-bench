The bug in your Verilog code is a **missing semicolon (`;`)** at the end of the `assign` statement. Here's a breakdown:

### Bug Analysis:
1. **Error Message**: `syntax error near endmodule` indicates the parser encountered an unexpected token (`endmodule`) where it expected something else.
2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```verilog
   assign c = a & b  // Missing semicolon here
   endmodule
   ```
3. **Why It Occurs**:
   - Verilog requires **every statement to end with a semicolon** (`;`).
   - The parser sees `assign c = a & b endmodule` as a single invalid statement (it expects a semicolon after `a & b`).
   - This violates Verilog's syntax rules, triggering the error at `endmodule`.

### Fix:
Add a semicolon to the end of the `assign` statement:
```verilog
module top13(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire c
);
    assign c = a & b;  // ← Semicolon added here
endmodule
```

### Why This Matters:
- **Continuous assignments** (`assign`) are statements like any other in Verilog and require terminators.
- Without the semicolon, the compiler thinks the assignment continues onto the next line (`endmodule`), causing a syntax collision.
- The fix aligns with standard Verilog syntax (refer to the context snippet: `wire y = a & b;` includes a semicolon).

This resolves the synthesis error while maintaining the intended functionality (`c = a AND b`). 

> 💡 **Prevention Tip**: Use linting tools or IDE syntax highlighting to catch missing terminators early. Most editors flag lines without semicolons in Verilog.
