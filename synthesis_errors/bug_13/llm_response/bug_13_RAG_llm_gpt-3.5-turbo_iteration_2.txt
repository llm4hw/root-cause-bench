The error in the Verilog code is a syntax error near the `endmodule` statement. In the provided Verilog code snippet, the error lies in the missing semicolon `;` at the end of the line `assign c = a & b`. 

To fix the error, the missing semicolon should be added at the end of the `assign` statement, like this:

```verilog
assign c = a & b;
```

After adding the semicolon, the code should be error-free and should not cause issues during simulation or synthesis.
