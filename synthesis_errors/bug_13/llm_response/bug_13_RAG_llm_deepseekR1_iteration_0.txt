Based on the error message and code analysis, here's the solution:

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Missing Semicolon**: The `assign` statement `assign c = a & b` is missing its terminating semicolon (`;`)
2. **Error Location**: The syntax error is detected near `endmodule` (line 31) because the parser expects either:
   - Continuation of the assignment statement
   - Another module item declaration
   - The semicolon terminator before the module ends

### Why This Causes a Syntax Error:
Verilog requires every statement to end with a semicolon. Without it:
1. The compiler continues parsing the next token (`endmodule`) as part of the assignment
2. `endmodule` becomes unexpected input after an incomplete expression
3. The error manifests at the module termination point because that's where the parser realizes the statement was never properly terminated

### Fix:
Add the missing semicolon to the assignment line:
```verilog
assign c = a & b;  // Added semicolon here
```

### Corrected Code:
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top13(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire c
);
    assign c = a & b;  // Fixed line
endmodule
```

### Why This Resolves the Issue:
- The semicolon properly terminates the continuous assignment statement
- The parser can now correctly recognize:
  1. The assignment as a complete module item
  2. `endmodule` as the valid module termination keyword
- The syntax error will no longer occur during simulation or synthesis

> ⚠️ Always verify statement termination in Verilog - missing semicolons are among the most common syntax errors, and the reported error location is often after the actual mistake.
