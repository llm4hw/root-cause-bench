The error message indicates a syntax error near the `endmodule` keyword on line 31, which suggests that there is a problem just before the `endmodule` statement. In Verilog, such syntax errors typically occur due to missing punctuation or incorrect expressions.

In the given Verilog code, the line before `endmodule` is:

```verilog
assign c = a & b
```

The issue here is that there is a missing semicolon (`;`) at the end of this line. In Verilog, every statement must end with a semicolon, and missing a semicolon is a common syntax error that can lead to the error message you're seeing.

This error is occurring because the Verilog syntax rules require a semicolon to terminate statements, and the absence of the semicolon causes the parser to expect more tokens, making it interpret the next keyword (`endmodule`) as something unexpected in the current context.

To fix this issue, a semicolon should be added at the end of the `assign` statement:

```verilog
assign c = a & b;
```

Once the semicolon is added, the Verilog code will have proper syntax, and the `endmodule` keyword will be correctly recognized by the parser as the conclusion of the module definition. This should resolve the syntax error during the simulation of the test bench.
