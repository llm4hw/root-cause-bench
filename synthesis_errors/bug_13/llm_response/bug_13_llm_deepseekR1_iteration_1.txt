The bug is a **missing semicolon (`;`)** in the continuous assignment statement.  

### Why the error occurs:
1. In the line `assign c = a & b`, there is no terminating semicolon.  
2. The Verilog parser expects a semicolon to mark the end of the `assign` statement.  
3. When the parser reaches `endmodule` without encountering the expected semicolon, it throws a syntax error at `endmodule` because it doesn't recognize the structure.  

### Root cause:
Verilog requires **every statement to end with a semicolon**. The missing semicolon breaks the parser's expected sequence:  
- The parser sees `assign c = a & b` and continues scanning for the semicolon.  
- Instead, it finds `endmodule`, which is invalid at this position in the statement flow.  

### Fix:
Add a semicolon (`;`) at the end of the assignment line:  
```verilog
assign c = a & b;  // Semicolon added here
```  

This will satisfy the parser's syntax rules and resolve the error. The error appears at `endmodule` because that's where the parser realizes the statement is incomplete.
