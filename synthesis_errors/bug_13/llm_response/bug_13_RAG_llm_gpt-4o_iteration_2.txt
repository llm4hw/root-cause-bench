The error message you're encountering is due to a missing semicolon at the end of the assignment statement within the module. In Verilog, each statement must be terminated with a semicolon. In the code you've provided:

```verilog
assign c = a & b
```

The statement is missing a semicolon at the end. This results in a syntax error at the `endmodule` line because the parser expects a semicolon to signify the end of the previous statement. To fix this issue, you simply need to add a semicolon at the end of the assignment:

```verilog
assign c = a & b;
```

With this correction, the syntax of your Verilog code should be correct and the error should be resolved. After adding the semicolon, save the file and re-run the simulation to ensure that the error does not occur again.
