The error message indicates a syntax error occurring near the `endmodule` line in the provided Verilog code. This is a common issue due to a careless mistake in the line directly preceding the `endmodule` keyword.

Looking at the full code, the line:

```verilog
assign c = a & b
```

is missing a semicolon at the end. In Verilog, each statement must be terminated with a semicolon to be syntactically correct. The lack of a terminating semicolon here causes the compiler to misinterpret the end of the statement and leads to a syntax error on the subsequent line where `endmodule` is encountered. 

Since the error is actually on the line before the `endmodule`, but the parser identifies the issue where it realizes something is wrong (on encountering `endmodule`), this can commonly result in the error message pointing to the wrong line.

To resolve this issue, you need to add a semicolon at the end of the assignment statement for `c`:

```verilog
assign c = a & b;
```

This change will correctly terminate the statement and eliminate the syntax error, allowing the code to compile correctly.
