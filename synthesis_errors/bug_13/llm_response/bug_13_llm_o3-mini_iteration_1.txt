The error being flagged indicates that the compiler/parser reached the endmodule without finding the expected syntax termination of a statement. In this case, the assign statement that computes c (assign c = a & b) is missing its required terminating semicolon. Because the semicolon is omitted, the parser continues reading the subsequent text (which is just "endmodule") as if it were part of the previous statement. This unexpected token causes the reported syntax error. The solution is to properly terminate the assign statement with a semicolon so that the compiler recognizes the end of that statement before encountering the module termination.

Remember, the error isnâ€™t necessarily with the endmodule itself, but rather with the missing semicolon in the previous logic.
