The error message is pointing to a syntax issue at the "endmodule" line because the parser reached it while still expecting a valid statement termination from a previous statement. In this case, the assign statement (assigning the result of the bitwise AND) is missing its terminating semicolon. Without the semicolon, the parser does not recognize the end of the assign statement, and when it encounters "endmodule," it raises a syntax error. 

This error occurs during simulation because the test bench sees the syntactic mistake and cannot proceed with correct compilation of the module. The solution is to add the necessary semicolon at the end of the assign statement so that the statement is properly terminated, allowing the parser to correctly recognize the "endmodule" keyword.
