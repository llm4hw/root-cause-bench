Based on the error message and code analysis, the bug is a **missing semicolon** in the `assign` statement. Here's the breakdown:

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Error Location**: The syntax error occurs at `endmodule` (line 31)
2. **Root Cause**:  
   The line `assign c = a & b` is missing its terminating semicolon (`;`).  
   Verilog requires all statements (including continuous assignments) to end with a semicolon.

3. **Why the Error Appears at `endmodule`**:  
   The parser expects a semicolon after `a & b`. When it doesn't find one, it continues scanning until it hits `endmodule`, treating everything between as part of the same statement. Since `endmodule` isn't valid in an assignment, it throws the error at that location.

### Fixed Code:
```verilog
module top13(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire c
);
    assign c = a & b;  // Added missing semicolon
endmodule
```

### Key Points:
- Verilog is **not whitespace-sensitive** – newlines don't terminate statements.
- Always verify **statement termination** (semicolons) before end-of-module declarations.
- This error would be caught by any Verilog compiler/simulator (e.g., Vivado, ModelSim) during analysis.

> 🔍 **Pro Tip**: Most IDEs (like VS Code with Verilog plugins) would flag this error immediately with a red squiggly line under `assign c = a & b`.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).
