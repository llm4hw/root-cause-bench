The bug in the code is a syntax error due to a missing semicolon (;) at the end of the `assign` statement in the `top13` module. Verilog requires statements to be terminated with a semicolon, and in this case, the missing semicolon right after `assign c = a & b` is causing the syntax error near `endmodule`.

To fix this issue, simply add a semicolon at the end of the `assign c = a & b` statement within the `top13` module. Once you add the semicolon, the syntax error should be resolved, and the code should compile successfully.
