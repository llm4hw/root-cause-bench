The issue is caused by a missing semicolon at the end of the assign statement. In Verilog, every statement must end with a semicolon, and without it, the compiler continues to treat the following line (in this case, the endmodule) as a continuation of the previous statement. By adding the missing semicolon, the syntax is corrected and the error will be resolved.

The fix is to modify the code as follows:

------------------------------------------------
assign c = a & b;
------------------------------------------------

This small change will eliminate the syntax error near the endmodule.
