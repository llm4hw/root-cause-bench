The issue is that the assignment statement is missing a semicolon at its end. In Verilog, every statement must be terminated with a semicolon. Because the semicolon is missing after the expression for output c, the simulator gets confused when it reaches the "endmodule" line, resulting in the syntax error.

This bug is occurring because the parser continues to expect further code on the same statement line and finds the module ending instead, which violates the syntax rules of Verilog.

To fix the issue, you need to add a semicolon at the end of the assignment statement, so that the line is properly terminated.
