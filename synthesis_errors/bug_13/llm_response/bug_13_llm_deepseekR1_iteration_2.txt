The error occurs due to a missing semicolon (`;`) in the continuous assignment statement. Here's why:

1. **Syntax Violation**: The line `assign c = a & b` lacks a terminating semicolon. In Verilog, all statements (including continuous assignments) must end with a semicolon.

2. **Parser Confusion**: The Verilog parser expects either:
   - A semicolon to terminate the assignment statement
   - Another valid statement after the assignment
   
   Instead, it encounters the `endmodule` keyword directly after the assignment expression.

3. **Error Location**: The error is reported at `endmodule` because that's where the parser first realizes the syntax is invalid. The actual error occurs earlier in the assignment line.

**Fix**: Add a semicolon at the end of the assignment statement:
```verilog
assign c = a & b;  // Add missing semicolon here
```
