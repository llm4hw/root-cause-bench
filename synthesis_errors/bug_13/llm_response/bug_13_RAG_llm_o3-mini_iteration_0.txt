The issue is that the assign statement is missing a semicolon. In your Verilog module, you have:

  assign c = a & b

Without the terminating semicolon, the parser doesn't correctly recognize the end of the statement, so when it reaches the "endmodule," it reports a syntax error since it's still expecting a proper termination of the previous statement.

To fix the bug, simply add a semicolon after the assign statement:

  assign c = a & b;

This will resolve the syntax error near the endmodule.
