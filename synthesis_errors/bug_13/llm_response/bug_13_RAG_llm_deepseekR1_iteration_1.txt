The bug in your Verilog code is a missing semicolon (`;`) at the end of the `assign` statement. Here's the breakdown:

**Bug Location:**
```verilog
assign c = a & b   // ← Missing semicolon here
endmodule
```

**Why the Error Occurs:**
1. Verilog requires every statement to end with a semicolon (`;`).
2. The parser reaches `endmodule` while still processing the incomplete `assign` statement.
3. The error `syntax error near endmodule` occurs because the compiler encounters `endmodule` where it expects either a semicolon or another part of the assignment expression.

**Fixed Code:**
```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module top13(
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    output wire c
);
    assign c = a & b;  // Added semicolon here
endmodule
```

**Why This Fix Works:**
- The semicolon properly terminates the continuous assignment statement
- The compiler can now correctly recognize `endmodule` as the end of the module declaration
- This is a fundamental syntax requirement in Verilog (similar to C/C++)

**Additional Notes:**
- The error message points to `endmodule` because that's where the parser realizes the previous statement is incomplete
- Always check for missing semicolons when you see syntax errors near closing keywords (`endmodule`, `endcase`, etc.)
- Most Verilog linters/IDEs would flag this error immediately with a message like "expected semicolon"

This is a common syntax mistake that's easily fixed by adding the required semicolon at the end of the assignment statement.
