The bug is that the code is trying to assign a value to an input port. In VHDL, ports declared with mode IN are read-only inside the entity, and you are not allowed to drive them from within the architecture. The assignment

  input1 <= '0';

is attempting to update the value of an object whose mode is IN, which causes the error message.

How to fix it:

• Remove the assignment from the architecture, or
• If you intend to drive the signal internally, modify the port’s declaration (for example, change the mode to BUFFER or OUT) or use an internal signal that is then assigned to the port. 

For instance, if you need a signal that is driven inside the entity and appears at the port, you could do:

  entity top3 is
   Port ( dummy_input : in  STD_LOGIC;
          output   : out STD_LOGIC);
  end top3;

  architecture Behavioral of top3 is
   signal internal_signal : STD_LOGIC;
  begin
   internal_signal <= '0';
   output <= internal_signal;
  end Behavioral;

By doing this, you ensure that you are not trying to drive an IN port directly.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block

individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
