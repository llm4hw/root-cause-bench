The error message indicates an attempt to update an "in" object, which refers to an input port, with a new value. In VHDL, input ports declared in an entity cannot be driven or assigned a value within the architecture. They are intended to receive signals from outside the module, not to be driven from within.

### Bug
The line causing the error is: 
```vhdl
input1 <= '0';
```
Here, `input1` is declared as an input port, and you're trying to drive it with a constant value `'0'` within the architecture. This assignment is not permitted for input ports because they should be driven by external signals.

### Why It Is Occurring
The error is occurring because there is a rule in VHDL that forbids assigning values to input ports within the architecture where they're declared. Since `input1` is defined as an "in" port, it is illegal to assign it any value inside the architecture.

### Fix
To fix this issue, you need to remove the line attempting to drive the input port. You should drive `input1` from an external testbench or a higher-level module. If `input1` is supposed to be controlled within another component, use appropriate signal wiring at the higher level.

Here's a fixed version of the architecture without trying to assign a value to `input1`:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    -- Here, input1 is left unchanged and should be driven by an external source.
end Behavioral;
```

To test this component, ensure your test bench or external module properly drives the `input1` port.
