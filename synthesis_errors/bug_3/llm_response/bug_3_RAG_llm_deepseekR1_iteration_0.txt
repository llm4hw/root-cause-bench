Based on the error message and code analysis, here's the breakdown of the issue and solution:

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Illegal Port Assignment**: 
   - `input1` is declared as an input port (`Port ( input1 : in  STD_LOGIC;`).
   - The line `input1 <= '0';` attempts to **drive a value into an input port**, which violates fundamental hardware design principles.

2. **Why Inputs Can't Be Assigned**:
   - Input ports represent external signals driven **into** the module (e.g., from a test bench or another component).
   - Assigning a value to an input internally creates a **multiple-driver conflict** (external driver vs. internal driver).
   - Synthesis tools correctly flag this as an illegal operation since it has no physical implementation in hardware.

### Fix:
**Remove the illegal assignment** and replace it with valid logic:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    output <= '0';  -- Valid: Driving the OUTPUT port
end Behavioral;
```

### Why This Fix Works:
- `output` is declared as an output port (`output : out STD_LOGIC`), so it **can** be driven internally.
- This corrected version synthesizes cleanly and matches the entity's port directionality.

### Additional Notes:
- If you need to initialize or manipulate `input1`:
  - Use it to drive outputs (e.g., `output <= not input1;`)
  - Create internal signals for manipulation (not needed in this minimal example).

**Root Cause**: Fundamental misuse of input port directionality in hardware description languages. Inputs are strictly read-only within their own module.

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-

signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
