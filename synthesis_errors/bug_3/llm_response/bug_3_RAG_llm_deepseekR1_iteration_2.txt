### Root Cause of the Error:
The error occurs because you're attempting to **assign a value to an input port (`input1`)**, which violates fundamental hardware description principles. In VHDL (and hardware design in general):  
- Input ports (`in`) are **read-only** signals driven externally by the test bench or parent module.  
- Output ports (`out`) are **write-only** signals driven internally by the entity.  

In your code:  
```vhdl
input1 <= '0';  -- ILLEGAL: Assigning to an input port
```
This is equivalent to trying to force a value into a hardware input pin from inside the chip, which is physically impossible and logically forbidden.

---

### Fix:
**Replace the illegal assignment to `input1` with a valid assignment to the output port `output`.**  

#### Corrected Code:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    output <= '0';  -- Assign to OUTPUT instead (valid)
end Behavioral;
```

#### Explanation:
- If your goal is to set the output to a constant `0`, use `output <= '0'`.  
- If you intended to pass the input value to the output (e.g., a buffer), use:  
  ```vhdl
  output <= input1;  -- Valid: Reading input and writing output
  ```

---

### Why This Fix Works:
1. **Synthesis Compliance**: Output ports (`out`) can be driven internally.  
2. **Simulation Safety**: The test bench retains control of `input1` (no driver conflicts).  
3. **Hardware Validity**: Reflects real-world hardware where inputs are externally driven.  

### Key Takeaway:
> 🔥 **Never assign values to `in` ports** in VHDL/Verilog. Treat inputs as read-only signals.
