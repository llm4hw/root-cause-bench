The error message you are receiving,  `[Synth 8-1789] cannot update 'in' object input1 [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_3/rtl/top3.vhd:42]`, is related to an attempt to assign a value to an input port, which is not allowed in Verilog. 

In your code snippet, you are trying to assign a value to the input port `input1` in the architecture section of your `top3` module:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    input1 <= '0';
end Behavioral;
```

Inputs in Verilog are meant to be driven externally, such as in a test bench, and cannot be assigned a value within the module itself. This assignment is causing the error message during synthesis.

To fix this issue, you should remove the assignment to the input port `input1` within the architecture. Inputs should only be associated with external signals driving them in the test bench or higher-level design hierarchy.

Once you remove the assignment in the architecture, your code should look like this:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    -- Add your logic for generating the output here
    
end Behavioral;
```

By making this adjustment, you will resolve the synthesis error related to trying to update an input object.

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would

“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
