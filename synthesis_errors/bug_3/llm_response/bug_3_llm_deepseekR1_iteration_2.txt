The error occurs because the code attempts to assign a value to an input port (`input1`), which violates fundamental VHDL port mode rules. Here's why:

1. **Port Mode Violation**:  
   `input1` is declared as `in STD_LOGIC` in the entity port list. Input ports (`in`) are **read-only** within their own entity architecture. They represent external signals driven into the module and cannot be modified internally.

2. **Illegal Assignment**:  
   The line `input1 <= '0';` attempts to drive the input port from inside the architecture. This is equivalent to trying to force a value onto an external signal feeding into the module, which is:
   - Syntactically invalid in VHDL
   - Electrically impossible in hardware (would create driver conflicts)

3. **Hardware Mismatch**:  
   In physical terms, an input port corresponds to a pin receiving signals from outside the chip/module. The code incorrectly tries to make this pin behave like an output driver.

**Fix Required**:  
The assignment must be removed or redirected:
- If the goal is to drive a default value to `output`, change the assignment to `output <= '0';`
- If the intent was to propagate the input, use `output <= input1;`
- If bidirectional control is needed (unlikely for simple logic), the port mode must change to `inout` and external driver conflicts must be resolved

The testbench likely failed because it tried to drive `input1` while the module simultaneously attempted to override it, causing unresolved signal contention.
