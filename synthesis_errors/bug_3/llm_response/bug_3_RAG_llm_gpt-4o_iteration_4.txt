The error is stemming from the attempt to assign a value to `input1`, which is defined as an input port in the `top3` entity. In VHDL, you cannot assign values to an `in` port directly within the architecture body, as input ports are meant to receive values from the external environment (e.g., another module or a test bench) rather than being driven internally.

**Root Cause:**
- The line `input1 <= '0';` is trying to drive a value onto `input1`, which is defined as an input port (signified by `in`) and thus cannot be driven by the architecture that declares it. Input ports are typically driven by signals from outside the entity.

**Fix:**
To resolve this error, you need to remove or revise the line `input1 <= '0';` so that you're not erroneously trying to drive an input port within the module. Instead, ensure that the test bench or another module properly provides a value for `input1` when the design is instantiated. For example, in the test bench, you'll instantiate the `top3` module and connect it with a signal to drive `input1`.

Here's an example fix by assuming you plan on using `input1` within a test bench setup:
1. Remove the line `input1 <= '0';` from the `Behavioral` architecture.

2. In your test bench, declare a signal that will drive `input1` and stimulate it accordingly.

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity top3_test is
end top3_test;

architecture testbench of top3_test is

    signal input1_signal : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Give initial value or drive it within the process
    signal output_signal : STD_LOGIC;

    -- Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
    component top3
        Port ( input1 : in  STD_LOGIC;
               output : out STD_LOGIC);
    end component;

begin

    -- Connect the test bench signal to the UUT input
    uut: top3 
        Port map (
            input1 => input1_signal,
            output => output_signal
        );

    -- Drive the input1_signal for testing purposes
    process
    begin
        -- Example stimulus
        input1_signal <= '0';
        wait for 10 ns;
        input1_signal <= '1';
        wait for 10 ns;
        -- Add further test scenarios
    end process;

end testbench;
```

This setup introduces a test bench where `input1_signal` is used to stimulate `input1`, aligning with the VHDL design principles and fixing the synthesis issue.
