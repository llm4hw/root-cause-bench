Based on the error message and code analysis, here's the breakdown of the bug and solution:

### The Bug:
You're attempting to assign a value (`'0'`) to an **input port** (`input1`), which violates fundamental VHDL port direction rules. Input ports are read-only signals within the entity.

### Why It's Occurring:
1. **Port Direction Violation**: 
   - `input1` is declared as `in STD_LOGIC` in the entity (line: `Port ( input1 : in STD_LOGIC;`)
   - The assignment `input1 <= '0';` tries to drive this input (write operation), which is illegal.

2. **Synthesis Tool Detection**:
   - The Xilinx synthesis tool (error `[Synth 8-1789]`) correctly flags this as an unsupported hardware operation. Input ports can only receive external signals, never drive them.

### The Fix:
**Remove the illegal assignment to `input1` and assign a value to `output` instead.** Here's the corrected code:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    output <= '0';  -- Assign to OUTPUT port instead
end Behavioral;
```

### Explanation:
- Input ports (`in`) are **read-only** - you can only use their values (e.g., `output <= input1;`).
- Output ports (`out`) are **write-only** - you must drive them with values.
- To fix this:
  1. Delete the line `input1 <= '0';`
  2. Add a valid assignment to `output` (e.g., constant `'0'`, or a function of `input1` like `not input1`)

### Corrected File:
```vhdl
entity top3 is
    Port ( input1 : in  STD_LOGIC;
           output : out STD_LOGIC);
end top3;

architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    output <= '0';  -- Fixed: Driving the output port
end Behavioral;
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: If you intended to initialize the input, remember this must be done **externally** (e.g., in the testbench). Internal assignments to inputs are physically impossible in hardware.
