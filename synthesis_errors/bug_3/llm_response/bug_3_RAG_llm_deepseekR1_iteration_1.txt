Based on the error message and code analysis, here's the breakdown of the bug and its solution:

### The Bug:
The core issue is that you're attempting to **assign a value to an input port** (`input1`). In VHDL (and hardware design in general), input ports are read-only signals within their own entity. The line `input1 <= '0';` violates this fundamental rule.

### Why It's Occurring:
1. **Port Direction Violation**: 
   - `input1` is declared as `in STD_LOGIC` in the port map, meaning it can only receive values from outside the entity
   - The assignment tries to drive this input port from inside the architecture, which is illegal in hardware description languages

2. **Synthesis vs. Simulation**:
   - This would fail in both simulation and synthesis
   - The error message `[Synth 8-1789]` specifically indicates the synthesis tool (Xilinx Vivado) detected this hardware impossibility

3. **Hardware Correspondence**:
   - In actual hardware, input ports correspond to physical pins that receive signals from external sources
   - You cannot drive an input pin from inside the chip - this would create a short circuit

### The Fix:
**Remove the illegal assignment to `input1` and instead assign to the output port:**

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    -- CORRECTED: Assign to OUTPUT instead of input
    output <= '0';  -- Example fixed assignment
end Behavioral;
```

### Explanation of Fix Options:
1. **Basic Fix** (if you want constant output):
   ```vhdl
   output <= '0';  -- Output constant 0
   ```

2. **Pass-through Fix** (if you want input to drive output):
   ```vhdl
   output <= input1;  -- Direct connection
   ```

3. **Internal Signal Fix** (if you need local modification):
   ```vhdl
   signal internal_sig : STD_LOGIC;
   begin
   internal_sig <= input1;  -- Legal: reading input
   output <= internal_sig;  -- Driving output
   ```

### Additional Recommendations:
1. **Initialization**: If you need to initialize values, do it on internal signals or outputs, never inputs
2. **Unused Ports**: If `input1` is unused, leave it unconnected rather than trying to drive it
3. **Testbench**: Drive `input1` from your testbench instead:
   ```vhdl
   -- In testbench:
   DUT: entity work.top3
        port map(input1 => tb_input,  -- Drive this from testbench
                 output => open);
   ```

This correction follows fundamental hardware design principles where input ports can only be read, not modified, within their own module. The synthesis error will disappear once you stop attempting to drive the input port.
