The error message you're encountering is indicative of an attempt to assign a value to a signal that has been declared as an input port. In VHDL, signals that are used as inputs cannot be driven or assigned a value within the architectureâ€”they are intended to receive their values from external sources (such as other modules or a test bench).

Here's a breakdown of why this issue is occurring and how to understand it:

1. **Signal Direction:** In your `entity top3`, `input1` is defined as an `in` port, which means it is read-only within the entity's architecture. An `in` port's value is expected to come from outside the module, such as another module or a test bench, and not be driven from within the module itself.

2. **Architecture Assignment:** The architecture of `top3` attempts to assign a constant value `'0'` to `input1`. This is not allowed, as `input1` is an `in` port and should receive its value from an external source rather than have a value assigned to it internally.

3. **Synthesis vs. Simulation:** This type of error might not manifest during synthesis, but during simulation, as external test benches might attempt to apply values to `input1`, resulting in a conflict or the synthesis tool recognizing an illegal assignment.

To resolve this error, you should remove or comment out the line `input1 <= '0';` within the architecture. The signal `input1` should be driven by whatever module or test bench is using `top3`, with value assignments managed outside the entity, reflecting its intended use as an input. Your test bench should provide the necessary stimulus or driving logic to `input1`, fulfilling its role as an input.
