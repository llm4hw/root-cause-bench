The bug in the provided code is that the assignment `input1 <= '0';` is attempting to update the 'in' object `input1`, which is not allowed in VHDL. 

In VHDL, signals declared as `in` within an entity are meant to be inputs to the design and cannot be directly assigned within the architecture as it violates the concept of the input being driven externally.

To fix this issue, you need to change the `in` type of `input1` to `inout` or `buffer`, or define an internal signal to hold the value '0' and then assign that signal to `input1` in the process.

Additionally, as a good practice, avoid using signal assignments in the architecture body for inputs and instead connect them in the testbench. 

To resolve this issue correctly and maintain the intended signal directionality, consider the proper use of signal types and avoid updating the `in` signals directly within the architecture.
