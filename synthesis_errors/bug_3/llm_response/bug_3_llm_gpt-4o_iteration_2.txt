The error you're encountering is due to an attempt to drive a signal declared as an 'in' object in VHDL, which is not allowed. In VHDL, signals that are declared with a mode of 'in' can only be read within the architecture where they are declared; they cannot be assigned a value. This is because 'in' designates the signal as an input to the entity, meaning it should only receive its value from an outside source, such as from an interconnected component or a test bench.

In your provided code, `input1` is an input port of the entity `top3`, and there is an attempt to drive it within the architecture `Behavioral` with the line `input1 <= '0';`. This line of code is trying to update the value of `input1`, which is inappropriate for a signal declared as an 'in' port.

Here's why this is problematic:

- **VHDL Port Modes:** The port mode 'in' specifies that the signal is an input into the entity and that it can only be read within that entity. Attempting to assign a value to it is attempting to override its value from within, directly conflicting with its designation as an input.
- **Signal Assignment:** VHDL enforces strict rules on port directions and does not allow assignment to an input port from within the module. Therefore, the compiler generates an error because it's contrary to the language's semantics for port directionality.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that assignments are only made to signals that can be driven from within the module. There are several ways to fix this, depending on the intended use of `input1`:

1. **If assignment to `input1` inside the module is necessary:** You may need to change the port mode to 'inout' or 'buffer' if modifying the signal internal to the module is indeed required. However, both solutions come with their implications:
   - **'inout'** is a bidirectional port, typically used for signals that need to be both driven and read by/from external modules.
   - **'buffer'** can also be used, which allows the signal to be assigned within the architecture. However, it should not have multiple drivers to avoid conflict.
   
2. **Reconsider the Design:** If `input1` is truly just an input, and you do not need to assign a value to it within the module, remove the assignment line (`input1 <= '0';`). Instead, ensure `input1` is being driven correctly by a test bench or interconnected module. 

In conclusion, evaluate the purpose of `input1`. Adjust either the port direction if it doesn't match its use or modify how its value is assigned from the outside to comply with VHDL's port direction rules. This understanding will clarify whether the design or test bench needs revisiting, or if the conceptual approach requires adjustment.
