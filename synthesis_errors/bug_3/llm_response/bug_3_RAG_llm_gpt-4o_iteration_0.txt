The error message you are encountering is due to an attempt to assign a value to an `in` mode port, which is not allowed in VHDL. 

### Bug Explanation:

In VHDL, an `in` mode port can only be read within the architecture; it cannot be assigned a value. Attempting to assign a value to an `in` port within the architecture, as seen in the line `input1 <= '0';`, is causing the error.

### Why It Occurs:

The line `input1 <= '0';` is trying to drive the signal `input1` which is already declared as an input port to the entity. Assigning values to input ports directly violates the rules of VHDL as input ports are meant to receive data from external signals or test benches, not to be internally driven.

### Fix:

To resolve this issue, you should not assign a value to `input1` directly in the architecture. If you need to provide a default value for `input1` during simulation or to test different scenarios, you should do this within the test bench, or change the port to an `inout` or `buffer` if you must manipulate it within the same module (though this is generally not recommended unless necessary).

Here are two possible solutions:

1. **Modification in Test Bench**: Control the simulation of `input1` from your test bench instead of within the module `top3`.

2. **Change Port Type**: If `input1` needs to be driven within the architecture for design reasons (which is unusual for input ports), reconsider your design topology or use a signal within the architecture.

The correct approach would typically be:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top3 is
begin
    -- Leave all manipulations of input1 to the testing environment.
end Behavioral;
```

Ensure the test bench is correctly providing values for `input1`. If you need specific initializations, set them in the test bench set-up phase.
