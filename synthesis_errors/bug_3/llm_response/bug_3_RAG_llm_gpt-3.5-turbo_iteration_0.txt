The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-1789] cannot update 'in' object input1 [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_3/rtl/top3.vhd:42]" is due to trying to make an assignment to an input port inside the entity. Input ports in an entity are meant to be driven from outside the entity, and thus you cannot assign a value to them within the architecture. This is incorrect behavior in the context of a synthesis tool.

To fix this issue, remove the assignment `input1 <= '0';` from the architecture section of your code. Input ports should be driven from external stimuli or signals during simulation; they are not designed to be assigned values within the entity. Modify your code so that input1 is not assigned a value within the entity architecture.

If you need to initialize input1 to a specific value, you can do so in your test bench code or wherever the input signal is being generated for simulation. But it is important to understand that input ports should not be assigned values within the entity architecture.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block

individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
