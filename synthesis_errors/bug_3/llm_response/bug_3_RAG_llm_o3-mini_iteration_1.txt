The error occurs because the code is trying to drive (assign a value to) an input port. In VHDL, input ports are read-only, which means you cannot assign any values to them within your architecture.

In your code, the line

  input1 <= '0';

is attempting to change the value of input1 even though it is declared as an input. This causes the error:

  "ERROR: [Synth 8-1789] cannot update 'in' object input1 …"

To fix the issue, you have two options:

1. If input1 is meant to be an externally driven signal (i.e., it should only be read by the design), remove the internal assignment to input1. The test bench or external circuitry should drive input1.

2. If you intended input1 to be driven internally, then you need to change its port mode from in to out (or inout, depending on your design requirements).

Choose the appropriate fix based on what the intended behavior of input1 is supposed to be.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block

individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
