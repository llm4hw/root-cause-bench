The bug in the provided code is related to the usage of the signal `input1` within the architecture of the entity `top3`. In VHDL, an `in` mode port is meant for inputs to the entity, and these ports cannot be driven inside the architecture where the entity is instantiated. 

In this case, the line `input1 <= '0';` inside the architecture of `top3` is trying to assign a value to the input port `input1`, which is not allowed. You cannot assign a value to an input port within the architecture; inputs should be driven by some external source. 

To fix this bug, you should remove the line `input1 <= '0';` from the architecture of the entity `top3`. If you need to assign an initial value to `input1`, you can do this in the test bench or at the place where the entity is instantiated in the test bench. 

Make sure the changes made reflect the intended design functionality.
