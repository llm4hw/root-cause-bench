The error message indicates an issue with an attempt to update an 'in' object, specifically `input1`. The line causing the error, `input1 <= '0';`, is trying to assign a value to `input1`, which is defined as an input port in the entity `top3`.

**Bug Explanation:**
- In VHDL, signals that are declared as inputs (`in`) cannot be driven or assigned within the architecture body. The direction `in` means that the signal is only supposed to be read or used as an input, not modified.

**Reason for Error:**
- The line `input1 <= '0';` in the architecture is attempting to drive a value to `input1`, which is not allowed since `input1` is declared as an input port.

**How to Fix:**
- If you want to assign a constant or signal value to `input1` for testing or any other reason, this should be done in the test bench rather than within the actual VHDL entity. You should drive the signal from the test bench environment, which can assign values to inputs of the design under test.

To resolve this error, remove the line `input1 <= '0';` from the architecture in `top3`. Instead, handle `input1` as follows in the test bench:

1. Instantiate the `top3` entity inside your test bench.
2. Assign values to `input1` within the test bench process or configuration block to simulate inputs as needed.

Here's an example of what the relevant part of the test bench might look like:

```vhdl
signal tb_input1 : std_logic := '0'; -- Test bench signal to drive input1
signal tb_output : std_logic;

-- Instantiate the top3 entity
uut: entity work.top3
    Port map (
        input1 => tb_input1,
        output => tb_output
    );

process
begin
    -- Assign values to tb_input1 here
    tb_input1 <= '0'; -- simulate input being '0'
    -- Add necessary wait statements or clock cycles as needed
    wait for 10 ns;
    tb_input1 <= '1'; -- change input to '1'
    wait;
end process;
```

In this test bench, `tb_input1` is a test bench signal that drives the actual `input1` port of the `top3` entity. Use the test bench to control the values being applied to the `input1` port during simulation.
