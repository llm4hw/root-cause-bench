The bug arises because the code is trying to assign a value to an input port. In VHDL, signals declared as inputs (mode "in") are read-only within the entity; you cannot drive or update them in your architecture. The synthesis and simulation tool flags this as an error because the port "input1" is only meant to receive values from outside the entity, not to be driven internally.

This error typically occurs when a designer mistakenly attempts to assign a value to an input port, possibly with the intention of using it as an internal signal or test signal. To address the issue, the declaration of "input1" must be reconsidered. In other words, if you need to drive "input1" within the design, then its mode should be changed to either "out" or "inout" (depending on what the design requires), or you should introduce an internal signal that can be assigned.
