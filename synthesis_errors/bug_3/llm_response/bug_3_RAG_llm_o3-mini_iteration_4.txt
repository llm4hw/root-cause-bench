The bug is that the code is attempting to drive an input port. In VHDL, signals declared as inputs (port mode "in") are meant to be driven by external sources (such as a test bench or another module) and cannot be updated or assigned values within the architecture of the module itself.

In your code, the statement

  input1 <= '0';

tries to update the input signal "input1", which causes the error:

  ERROR: [Synth 8-1789] cannot update 'in' object input1

To fix the issue, you have a few options:

1. Remove the assignment if you don’t intend to drive the input. The module should treat "input1" as a value coming from the outside world.

2. If the intention was to initialize or drive a signal within the design, then declare a separate internal signal (or change the port mode of "input1" to an output if it is supposed to be driven internally).

For example, if you intended "input1" to be an output, then modify the entity port list:

  Port ( input1 : out STD_LOGIC;
       output : out STD_LOGIC);

Otherwise, simply remove the assignment to "input1" from the architecture and allow the test bench to drive it.

The underlying issue is that in VHDL, only signals declared with mode "out", "buffer", or "inout" can be assigned within the architecture. Input (mode "in") signals are read-only within the design, so any attempt to update them will result in an error.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block

individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
