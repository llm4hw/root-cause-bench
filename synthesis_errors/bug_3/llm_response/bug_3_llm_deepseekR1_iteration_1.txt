The bug occurs because you are attempting to assign a value to an input port (`input1`) within the architecture. Here's why this is invalid:

1. **Port Direction Violation**:  
   `input1` is declared as `in STD_LOGIC` in the port list. Input ports are **read-only** from the entity's internal perspective. They can only be driven externally (e.g., by a testbench or parent module).

2. **Illegal Assignment**:  
   The line `input1 <= '0';` tries to drive the input port from inside the `top3` architecture. This creates a conflict since:
   - Input ports must only receive values from outside the module
   - Synthesis tools prohibit driving inputs internally (as reflected in the error)

3. **Missing Output Logic**:  
   The architecture contains no valid assignments to the output port `output`. The only assignment targets an input, which is fundamentally incorrect.

**Fix Required**:  
Remove the illegal input assignment and implement proper output logic. For example:  
- To hard-wire the output: `output <= '0';`  
- To pass through the input: `output <= input1;`  
- Or implement combinational/sequential logic using `input1` to drive `output`

The core issue is violating VHDL's port direction rulesâ€”inputs cannot be driven internally. The solution involves redesigning the architecture to only drive outputs/internal signals.
