### Bug Analysis:
The error occurs due to a mismatch between the **reset edge sensitivity** in the `always` block's event control and the **reset condition logic** inside the block.

#### Root Cause:
1. **Event Control**:  
   `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset)` specifies:  
   - Triggered on **rising edge of `clk`**  
   - Triggered on **falling edge of `reset`** (implies active-low reset)  

2. **Condition Mismatch**:  
   The condition `if (!reset == 0)` is equivalent to `if (reset == 1)`, which:  
   - Checks for **reset HIGH** (inactive state)  
   - Conflicts with the `negedge reset` (which expects active-low behavior)  

   This violates synthesis rules because:  
   - `negedge reset` expects the condition to test for **reset = 0** (active state)  
   - Your condition tests for **reset = 1** (inactive state)  

---

### Fix:
Change the reset condition to check for the **active-low state** of `reset`:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
    if (!reset) begin   // Active when reset=0 (matches negedge trigger)
        led <= 1'b0;    // Reset action
    end else begin
        led <= 1'b1;    // Normal operation
    end
end
```

#### Key Changes:
1. **Condition Simplified**:  
   `if (!reset)` checks for **reset = 0** (active state), matching `negedge reset`.

2. **Synthesis Rule Compliance**:  
   - `negedge reset` in sensitivity list requires `if (!reset)`  
   - `posedge reset` would require `if (reset)`  

---

### Why This Matters:
Synthesis tools enforce strict correspondence between edge triggers and conditions to ensure correct hardware mapping:
- `negedge reset` + `if (!reset)` → Asynchronous reset flip-flop  
- Mismatched conditions create undefined behavior (like unintended latches or priority conflicts)

### Fixed Code:
```verilog
module top21(
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg led
);
    always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
        if (!reset) begin    // Correct active-low check
            led <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            led <= 1'b1;
        end
    end
endmodule
```

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

“1111,” it rolls over to “0000” and continues counting because it is declared to only contain 4-bits.
