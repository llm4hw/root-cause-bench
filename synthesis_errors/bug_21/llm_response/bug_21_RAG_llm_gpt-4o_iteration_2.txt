The error message you're encountering suggests a problem with the expression in your Verilog code, specifically in the line `if (!reset == 0)`. Let's break down the issue and the solution:

### Bug and Explanation:
1. **Expression Error**: The condition `if (!reset == 0)` is not correct. Using `==` in this context is inappropriate because it results in a logical comparison following a logical negation, which isn't typically how Verilog conditions should be structured.

2. **Logical Error**: In Verilog, `!reset` is used to check if `reset` is active low (i.e., when `reset` is 0). There is no need for further comparison with `0`. This may lead to unexpected behavior due to misunderstanding what `!reset == 0` would logically compute to.

3. **Syntax and Semantics**: The `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset)` means that the block should be sensitive to the rising edge of `clk` or the falling edge of `reset`. When `reset` is asserted (which in a negedge reset system means `reset` is 0), you typically want to initialize or reset your logic, not compare an unnecessary condition. 

### Fix:
You should directly use `if (!reset)` for the reset condition instead of using `== 0`. This correction aligns with the intended use of an active-low reset signal.

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
    if (!reset) begin
        led <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        led <= 1'b1;
    end
end
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The condition `if (!reset)` will execute when the reset signal is low, making it an effective reset condition.
- This aligns with typical practices where a negedge reset system uses `!reset` to check the reset assertion. 

By correcting the logical condition, the code should now function correctly in simulation and synthesis should reflect the intended behavior without errors.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Verilog model and simulation waveform for this counter. When the counter reaches its maximum value of
“1111,” it rolls over to “0000” and continues counting because it is declared to only contain 4-bits.
