The problem is that the reset condition within the if statement is written in a way that doesn’t match the polarity defined by the sensitivity list. In your sensitivity list you use “negedge reset” (indicating an active‐low reset), but then inside the always block the reset is checked with an expression that inverts it and compares to 0 (“if (!reset == 0) begin”). This mismatch creates ambiguity for the synthesis (or simulation) tool concerning how exactly the reset condition is being detected.

What’s happening is that the expression “!reset == 0” ends up being evaluated in a way that doesn’t clearly signal “reset is asserted” in the expected polarity. The tool sees that the edge used in the sensitivity list (the negative edge of reset) does not directly correspond to how the condition is being tested inside the block. That is why you get an error indicating that the condition using operand “reset” does not match with the event control specification.

The root cause is the unusual and confusing way the reset condition is formulated rather than directly testing the reset signal. To resolve this, the condition inside the always block should directly and clearly check the reset signal in a manner that corresponds to its asynchronous active-low edge sensitivity (for example, by directly testing for the reset being low rather than using the “!reset == 0” expression).
