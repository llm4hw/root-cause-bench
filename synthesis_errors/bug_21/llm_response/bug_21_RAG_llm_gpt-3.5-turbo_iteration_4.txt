The bug in the code is in the `if (!reset == 0)` line. The error message indicates that the expression condition using operand `reset` does not match with the corresponding edges used in event control.

To fix this issue, you should update the `always` block sensitivity list to include both `posedge clk` and `negedge reset`. Additionally, adjust the `if` statement to simply check `if (!reset)` without comparing it to 0. Here's the corrected code:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
    if (!reset) begin
        led <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        led <= 1'b1;
    end
end
```

By updating the sensitivity list and the if condition as mentioned above, the code should work correctly without generating the error message.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

- source_documents\Quick Start Guide to Verilog.pdf: reset condition. Both the Clock and Reset signals are listed in the sensitivity list. Within the block, an

Verilog model and simulation waveform for this counter. When the counter reaches its maximum value of
“1111,” it rolls over to “0000” and continues counting because it is declared to only contain 4-bits.
