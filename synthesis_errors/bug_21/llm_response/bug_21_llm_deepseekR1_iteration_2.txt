The bug arises from a mismatch between the edge sensitivity in the event control and the reset condition logic. Here's why:

1. **Event Control Mismatch**:  
   The `always` block uses `@(posedge clk or negedge reset)`, implying:  
   - `negedge reset` indicates an *active-low* asynchronous reset (resets when `reset=0`).  

2. **Incorrect Reset Condition**:  
   The condition `if (!reset == 0)` is equivalent to `if (reset == 1)`. This:  
   - Checks for *reset inactive* (`reset=1`) instead of *active* (`reset=0`)  
   - Contradicts the `negedge reset` sensitivity (which expects reset logic to trigger when `reset=0`).  

3. **Synthesis Rule Violation**:  
   Synthesis tools require strict correspondence between:  
   - Edge sensitivity (`negedge reset`)  
   - Reset condition (`if (condition)` must directly test for the *active state* of the reset signal).  
   Here, the condition tests the *inactive state* (`reset=1`), causing the error.

**Fix Principle**:  
Change the reset condition to directly test for the active-low state:  
- Use `if (!reset)` or `if (reset == 0)` to align with `negedge reset`.  
This ensures the reset logic activates when `reset=0`, matching the sensitivity list.  

**Side Note**:  
The logic also contains a functional issue where `led` is set to `1'b1` in the non-reset path, but this doesn't contribute to the reported synthesis error. The primary issue is the reset condition mismatch.
