The error message you're encountering is due to an incorrect condition in the `if` statement within the `always` block. Specifically, the condition `if (!reset == 0)` is incorrect because it does not match the corresponding edge control used in the event control list (`posedge clk or negedge reset`).

**Analysis of the Error:**

1. **Edge Sensitivity List:** 
   - The `always` block is sensitive to the `posedge clk` and `negedge reset`.
   - This means the block will execute on the rising edge of `clk` or the falling edge (active low) of `reset`.

2. **Condition Mistake:**
   - The condition `if (!reset == 0)` is intended to check if `reset` is active (logical low).
   - However, the expression `!reset == 0` is misleading because it implies comparison after negation.
   - Instead, `!reset` is sufficient to check for an active low reset.

3. **Mismatch Error:** 
   - The expression in `if` does not appropriately utilize a simple low check, causing a mismatch as the sensitivity list specifies a `negedge` for `reset`, which naturally complements with `if (!reset)`.

**Fix:**

To resolve the error, modify the condition to directly check for the active low condition with `reset`. Here is the corrected `always` block:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
    if (!reset) begin
        led <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        led <= 1'b1;
    end
end
```

**Explanation:**

- **Change:** `if (!reset == 0)` is replaced with `if (!reset)`.
- **Reason:** The condition `!reset` is used to properly check if `reset` is low, which matches the `negedge` specification in the sensitivity list.
- **Outcome:** This change ensures that the `always` block behaves correctly when `reset` is active low, addressing the synthesis error and aligning with conventional practices for reset condition checks.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

“1111,” it rolls over to “0000” and continues counting because it is declared to only contain 4-bits.
