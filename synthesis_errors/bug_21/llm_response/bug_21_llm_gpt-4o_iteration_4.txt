The error you are encountering stems from a logical issue in the conditional expression within the `always` block that is triggered by clock and reset events. Specifically, the error message and the conditional expression: `if (!reset == 0)` suggest there is a misunderstanding in the use of logical operators.

### Problem Explanation:

1. **Expression Logic Error**:
   - The expression `!reset == 0` is intended to check for the deasserted state of the reset signal. However, due to the way precedence works, this expression is not evaluated as expected. The `!` operator (logical NOT) has higher precedence than `==`. Therefore, this expression is equivalent to `(!reset) == 0`, which evaluates to `true` when `reset` is `1`. This is usually the opposite of typical conditional logic used for active-low resets.

2. **Mismatch with Event Control**:
   - The `always` block is triggered by `(posedge clk or negedge reset)`. This means the block reacts to either a rising edge on the clock signal or a falling edge on the reset signal (active-low reset). However, the condition `if (!reset == 0)` is flawed because when `reset` is active (i.e., `0`), `!reset` becomes `1`, which makes `(!reset == 0)` false. This leads to an inconsistency between the edge that triggers the block and the logic that follows in the conditional statement.

### Why It Occurs:

- **Non-intuitive Logic**: The conditional statement inside the `always` block doesn't align with the typical logic used for checking an active-low reset. This inversion results in incorrect logical flow, making it difficult to reason about the state of `reset`.

- **Operator Precedence and Grouping**: Logical and equality operators have precedence rules that need careful application, especially when evaluating combinations of logic in expressions.

### Steps to Resolve:

- The `if` condition should directly reflect the active-low characteristic of the reset signal, without inadvertently reversing the intended logic through precedence accidents.

- In general, to check if `reset` is active (logic `0`), the condition should straightforwardly compare `reset` to its active state (`0`). However, due to their request not to provide code, understand that this needs a clean and logical comparison reflecting the intention of checking when the reset is active.

By adjusting the logical flow and ensuring the precedence of operations reflects the intended operation, this error should resolve and allow consistent behavior aligned with the reset signal's nature in both simulation and synthesis environments.
