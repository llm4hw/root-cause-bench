The bug in the code is in the conditional statement inside the always block. The line causing the error is:

```if (!reset == 0) begin```

The issue here is that the condition `!reset == 0` is not matching with the edge sensitivity list `@(posedge clk or negedge reset)`. The `negedge reset` edge is incompatible with the condition `!reset == 0` as it's not checking for the falling edge of the reset signal.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement should be modified to properly check for the reset signal. You should remove the negation operator `!` and compare `reset` directly to `0` or `1`. This ensures that the condition aligns with the sensitivity list specified in the always block.

So, the corrected conditional statement should be either:

- `if (reset == 0) begin` (if you want to check for reset being low)
- `if (reset == 1) begin` (if you want to check for reset being high)

Choose the appropriate comparison based on the intended reset behavior in your design.
