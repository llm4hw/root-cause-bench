The bug in the code is in the conditional statement within the always block:

```if (!reset == 0) begin```

The error message indicates that the expression condition using operand 'reset' does not match with the corresponding edges used in the event control. This error is occurring because the condition `(!reset == 0)` in Verilog is not the correct way to check the value of the reset signal. The expression `!reset` in Verilog will evaluate to either 1 or 0 based on the value of 'reset' at that point in time. Using `!reset == 0` is not a proper way to compare the value of 'reset' and can lead to synthesis or simulation issues.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to check the value of 'reset' directly without using logical operators incorrectly. The correct statement should be 
```
if (reset == 0) begin
```
This will properly check if reset is active low (equal to 0) and execute the corresponding logic in the always block accordingly.
