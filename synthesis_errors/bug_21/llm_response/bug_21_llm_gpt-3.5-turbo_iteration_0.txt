The error in the Verilog code is due to the incorrect usage of the 'reset' signal in the sensitivity list of the always block. 

In Verilog, the sensitivity list in an always block should specify the list of signals that can trigger the block to execute when there is a change in their value. In this case, the always block is triggered on the posedge of clk and the negedge of reset.

The bug occurs in the condition inside the if statement: `if (!reset == 0)`. The `!reset` statement negates the value of 'reset', so it is essentially checking if 'reset' is zero. This logic is incorrect and can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the condition in the if statement should be modified to check if 'reset' is equal to 0 without negating the signal. The correct condition should be: `if (reset == 0)`. This change ensures that the code correctly checks if 'reset' is low to proceed with the desired logic.

By making this adjustment, the error related to expression condition mismatch with the corresponding edges used in event control should be resolved.
