The error you're encountering originates from the line:

```verilog
if (!reset == 0) begin
```

The issue here is a confusion caused by using both the logical NOT operator `!` and comparison `==` in a way that the expression doesn't resolve properly for synthesis and simulation tools.

### Why is it occurring?

1. **Operator Precedence:** The expression `!reset == 0` is not well-formed. The `!` operator (logical NOT) has higher precedence than `==` (comparison), meaning that `!reset` will evaluate to a boolean (`1` or `0`), which is then compared to `0`. This is likely not the intended check.

2. **Incorrect Check:** The condition you're trying to check seems to be if `reset` is deasserted (`0`). However, this specific check should be done correctly without using double negation.

### Fix:

Instead, you should directly check the state of `reset`:

1. **Correct Condition Check:** Use `if (!reset)` directly to check if `reset` is low (asserted). This will simplify your code and remove ambiguity:

```verilog
if (!reset) begin
    led <= 1'b0;
end else begin
    led <= 1'b1;
end
```

This simplifies the logic and aligns with best practices for edge-sensitive always blocks. Here, `!reset` implicitly checks if `reset` is `0` directly, which was the original intention.

This fix should resolve the error by ensuring the expression condition is consistent with the edge condition you are monitoring in the event control block.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

“1111,” it rolls over to “0000” and continues counting because it is declared to only contain 4-bits.
