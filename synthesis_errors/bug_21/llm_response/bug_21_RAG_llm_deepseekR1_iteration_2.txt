Based on the error message and analysis of your code, here's the bug, why it occurs, and how to fix it:

**The Bug**:  
The condition `if (!reset == 0)` incorrectly handles the asynchronous reset signal. This expression is equivalent to `if (reset == 1)`, which is the opposite of what the sensitivity list expects for a negative-edge triggered reset.

**Why It Occurs**:  
1. Your sensitivity list uses `negedge reset` (line: `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset)`)
2. This means the block should trigger when reset goes **low** (0), indicating an active-low reset
3. But your condition checks `(!reset == 0)` → which means "if reset is high" (since !0=1 and !1=0)
4. Synthesis tools require the condition to match the sensitivity edge:
   - `negedge reset` requires a `reset == 0` condition
   - `posedge reset` would require `reset == 1`

**The Fix**:  
Change the reset condition to check for active-low state:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
    if (!reset) begin  // Changed from (!reset == 0)
        led <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
        led <= 1'b1;
    end
end
```

**Explanation**:  
- `!reset` is the correct active-low check (true when reset=0)
- This matches the `negedge reset` in the sensitivity list
- The corrected code will properly initialize `led` to 0 when reset is asserted (low), and set it to 1 otherwise

**Key Takeaways**:  
1. **Sensitivity list and condition must match**:  
   - `negedge signal` requires `if (!signal)`  
   - `posedge signal` requires `if (signal)`  

2. Active-low reset convention:  
   Reset is typically active-low in FPGA designs (0 = reset state, 1 = normal operation)

3. Synthesis vs Simulation:  
   While this might simulate correctly, synthesis tools strictly enforce this matching for proper hardware inference (flip-flops with async reset pins).

The fixed code now correctly implements an asynchronous active-low reset synchronized to the negative edge of the reset signal.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Verilog model and simulation waveform for this counter. When the counter reaches its maximum value of
“1111,” it rolls over to “0000” and continues counting because it is declared to only contain 4-bits.
