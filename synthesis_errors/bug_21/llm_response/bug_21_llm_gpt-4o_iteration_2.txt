The error message you're encountering in your Verilog code relates to how the conditional expression in the `if` statement inside your always block is formulated. The specific line of code raising the error is:

```verilog
if (!reset == 0) begin
```

**Issue Explanation:**

1. **Problematic Expression:** The expression `(!reset == 0)` is not clear in terms of intent because it seems like you might be trying to check for when `reset` is deasserted or asserted. However, this expression is syntactically confusing.

2. **Operator Precedence:** The preprocessor evaluates `!reset == 0` in a way that may not be initially apparent. It evaluates `!reset`, which negates the reset signal to a 1-bit result and then compares this with 0 using the `==` equality operator. The result of `!reset` will be either `1` or `0`, making this a confusing way to express a condition: if you want to specifically check the value of `reset`, you should do so directly.

3. **Event Control:** In your always block sensitivity list, you have `posedge clk or negedge reset`. This indicates you want to execute the block either on the rising edge of the `clk` or the falling edge of `reset`. The `if (!reset == 0)` check might be intended to check if `reset` is low; however, this is an awkward expression to express such intent.

**Root Cause:**
The expression in the `if` statement doesn't match what is likely your intended control logic for a reset condition, and the synthesis tool is checking for consistency between how edges are used in the event control and within the body of the always block.

**Resolution Explanation:**
To correctly assess the `reset` condition, you should write the if condition more clearly in a way that directly checks the state of the `reset` signal. Instead of using `!reset == 0`, you can simply check if `reset` is low by directly using `reset` in a clear logical condition. Reevaluate the logic based on how you intend to handle the reset active state, considering the event control's specification.

In summary, modify the if statement to clearly reflect your intent to check the reset signal state rather than using a possibly misleading combination of negation and equality comparison. The synthesis error points out this inconsistency in intention and operational clarity between your signal edge conditions and your described logic.
