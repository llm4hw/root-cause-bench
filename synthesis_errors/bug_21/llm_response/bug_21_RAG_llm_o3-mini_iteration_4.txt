The bug is in the reset condition expression "if (!reset == 0)". This expression is written in a confusing way that does not match the event control in the always block (which is "posedge clk or negedge reset"). Essentially, by writing "if (!reset == 0)" you’re comparing the negated value of reset to 0, which is unnecessary and can be misinterpreted by synthesis and simulation tools.

In an asynchronous active‐low reset design, you want the reset branch to execute when reset is low. The proper way to express that is either:

  if (!reset)      // or equivalently if (reset == 1’b0)

The current expression "if (!reset == 0)" inadvertently inverts the logic of reset (i.e. it ends up checking if reset is high) and therefore does not match the negedge sensitivity on reset. This mismatch is what causes the tools to report that “the expression condition using operand 'reset' does not match with the corresponding edges used in event control.”

To fix the problem, simply change the condition to one of the following correct forms:

Option 1 (most common for an active‐low reset):
  if (!reset) begin
    led <= 1’b0;
  end else begin
    led <= 1’b1;
  end

Option 2 (by explicitly comparing reset to 0):
  if (reset == 1’b0) begin
    led <= 1’b0;
  end else begin
    led <= 1’b1;
  end

This ensures that when the reset signal goes low (triggering the negedge), the if-condition correctly registers the reset and the led signal is set to 0 as intended.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...

Verilog model and simulation waveform for this counter. When the counter reaches its maximum value of
“1111,” it rolls over to “0000” and continues counting because it is declared to only contain 4-bits.
