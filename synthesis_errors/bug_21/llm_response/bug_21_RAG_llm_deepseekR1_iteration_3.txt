### Analysis of the Error

The synthesis error occurs because the condition in the `if` statement (`!reset == 0`) does not match the edge sensitivity declared in the `always` block's event control (`negedge reset`). Here's why:

1. **Event Control Sensitivity**:
   - `always @(posedge clk or negedge reset)` means:
     - The block triggers on the **rising edge of `clk`**.
     - The block triggers on the **falling edge of `reset`** (active-low reset).

2. **Incorrect Reset Condition**:
   - The condition `if (!reset == 0)` is equivalent to `if (reset == 1)` because:
     - `!reset` inverts `reset` (e.g., `reset=0` → `!reset=1`).
     - `1 == 0` evaluates to `false`.
   - This checks for **`reset` being HIGH**, which contradicts the `negedge reset` sensitivity (which expects reset to be active when **LOW**).

### Why This Causes an Error
- Synthesis tools require the reset condition inside the block to **match the edge sensitivity**:
  - `negedge reset` implies an **active-low reset** (reset occurs when `reset=0`).
  - The condition `!reset == 0` (i.e., `reset == 1`) tries to treat `reset` as **active-high**.
- This mismatch creates ambiguity in the hardware behavior, leading to the synthesis error.

### Solution
Change the reset condition to check for **active-low reset**:
```verilog
if (!reset) begin  // Reset when reset=0 (active-low)
    led <= 1'b0;
end
```

### Fixed Code
```verilog
module top21(
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg led
);
    always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) begin
        if (!reset) begin  // Correct active-low check
            led <= 1'b0;  // Reset action
        end else begin
            led <= 1'b1;  // Normal operation
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Key Fixes
1. **Condition Updated**: `if (!reset)` correctly checks for `reset=0` (active-low).
2. **Hardware Consistency**: The reset condition now aligns with `negedge reset` sensitivity.
3. **Synthesis Compatibility**: Eliminates the edge/condition mismatch error.

### Explanation
- **Active-Low Reset**: When `reset=0`, the `if (!reset)` condition becomes true, triggering the reset action (`led <= 0`).
- **Edge Alignment**: The `negedge reset` event (falling edge) corresponds to `reset` transitioning from HIGH→LOW, activating the reset logic as expected.

This fix ensures the design synthesizes correctly into a flip-flop with an asynchronous active-low reset.

Let’s look at a simple model of how an initial block is used to model the reset line in a test bench. In
the following example, the signal “Reset_TB” is being driven into a DUT. At the beginning of the
simulation, the initial value of Reset_TB is set to a logic zero. The second assignment will take place
after a delay of 15 time units. The second assignment statement sets Reset_TB to a logic one. The...
