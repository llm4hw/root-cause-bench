The error occurs due to a mismatch between the reset edge sensitivity in the event control and the condition check in the `if` statement. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Event Control Mismatch**:  
   The sensitivity list `@(posedge clk or negedge reset)` declares an asynchronous active-low reset. This means:
   - `negedge reset` triggers the block when reset transitions from high to low (active-low reset)
   - The hardware expects the reset condition to be checked as `reset == 0` (active when low)

2. **Inverted Reset Condition**:  
   The problematic line `if (!reset == 0)` evaluates as:
   - `!reset` inverts the signal (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1)
   - `== 0` checks if this inverted value is 0  
   This is logically equivalent to `if (reset == 1)`, which:
   - Checks for reset being **high** (inactive state)
   - Contradicts the `negedge reset` declaration (which expects active-low behavior)

3. **Synthesis Error Cause**:  
   Synthesis tools require the reset condition to directly match the edge sensitivity:
   - `negedge reset` must pair with `if (!reset)` or `if (reset == 0)`  
   - `posedge reset` must pair with `if (reset)`  
   The current condition `if (!reset == 0)` implements an active-*high* check while the sensitivity list expects active-*low*, causing a template mismatch.

**Fix Direction**:  
Modify the reset condition to match the active-low behavior implied by `negedge reset`. Replace the condition with one that checks for the active state (reset low) without the double inversion. The reset action should trigger when `reset` is low (0), not high (1).
