The error in this code is occurring due to the incorrect usage of the `reset` signal in the sensitivity list of the always block. Specifically, the issue lies in the condition check of the if statement inside the always block.

In Verilog, the negedge or posedge operator is used to detect the rising or falling edge of a signal. In this case, the sensitivity list contains both the posedge of `clk` and the negedge of `reset`. However, the condition in the if statement `if (!reset == 0)` is not correct.

To fix this issue:
1. Modify the condition in the if statement to correctly check the value of `reset`.
2. Ensure that the condition in the if statement matches the behavior expected when `reset` is asserted or de-asserted properly, keeping in mind the synchronous logic design principles.

By addressing these points, you can correct the bug in the code and enable it to work as intended.
