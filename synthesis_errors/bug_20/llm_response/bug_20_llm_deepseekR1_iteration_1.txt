### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because the `while (flag)` loop in the combinational `always @*` block creates an **infinite loop** during synthesis. Here's why:

1. **Static Condition**:  
   `flag` is initialized to `1'b1` (true) and never modified within the module. This makes the loop condition `while (flag)` perpetually true.

2. **Combinational Loop**:  
   The `always @*` block implies combinational logic. Since the loop has:
   - No exit condition (as `flag` never changes)
   - No timing controls (e.g., `@(posedge clk)`)
   - No event-based break (e.g., `#delay`),
   the synthesis tool attempts to unroll the loop indefinitely, hitting its iteration limit (65,536 cycles).

3. **Non-Blocking Assignment Issue**:  
   `out <= ~out` creates a **feedback loop**:
   - `out` is both an input (to `~out`) and output
   - No new values are introduced to break the loop.

### Why This Fails Synthesis/Simulation:
- **Synthesis**: Hardware cannot resolve an infinite combinational loop. The tool exhausts its loop-unrolling capacity.
- **Simulation**: Even if synthesized, this would cause a zero-delay oscillation (hanging simulation) as `out` toggles infinitely fast in the same timestep.

### Fix Approach:
1. **Replace `always @*` with sequential logic**:  
   Use `always @(posedge clk)` to synchronize toggling with clock edges.

2. **Eliminate the infinite loop**:  
   Remove the `while` loop entirely. Toggling can be done with a simple assignment per clock cycle.

3. **Initialize `out` (optional)**:  
   Add a reset mechanism to set `out` to a known initial state if needed.

### Key Insight:
Hardware loops **must** have:
- A bounded exit condition, or
- Synchronization (clock edges) to break combinational continuity.  
Combinational blocks (`always @*`) should never contain unbounded loops or internal state dependencies like `out <= ~out`.
