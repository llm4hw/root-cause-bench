The bug is that the while loop never terminates. In your always block you have

  while (flag) begin  
    out <= ~out;  
  end

Since flag is initialized to 1 and is never changed inside the loop, the condition always holds true. Moreover, the loop does not contain any time-step event (like a delay), so it becomes an infinite loop during simulation. The synthesis tool has a built‐in loop iteration limit (here, 65,536), and exceeding that limit causes the error.

To fix the problem, you need to ensure the loop will eventually terminate or restructure your design. For example, if your intention is to generate a toggling output on every clock edge, you should use a clocked (edge-sensitive) always block rather than a combinational one. One way to fix the code is:

  always @(posedge clk) 
  begin  
    out <= ~out;  
  end

Alternatively, if you intended to use a loop with delays (which is acceptable only in simulation or test benches, not synthesizable logic), then add a delay so the loop will advance time and eventually terminate. For instance, if you really need the loop in simulation, you might write:

  initial
  begin  
    while (flag)
    begin  
      #10 out = ~out;   // time delay added
      // Add conditions to eventually set flag = 0 if needed  
    end  
  end

However, for synthesizable design, using a loop like this in an always @* block is not appropriate. In summary, the infinite loop (flag never changing and no delay) causes the loop limit to be exceeded, and fixing it involves using a proper clocked process or condition so that the loop does not run indefinitely without time steps.
