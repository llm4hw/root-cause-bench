The error you are encountering is due to an infinite loop in your Verilog code. This is caused by the `while (flag)` loop inside the `always @*` block, which does not contain any delay or condition to exit the loop. As a result, the loop iterates indefinitely, exceeding the limit of 65536 iterations imposed by the synthesis tool.

### Why the Error is Occurring:
1. **Infinite Loop**: The `while (flag)` loop will continue executing without any break condition or delay, as `flag` is never updated or set to `0` within the loop.
2. **Synthesis Limit Exceeded**: Synthesis tools have a limit on the number of iterations they will simulate for loops to prevent infinite execution scenarios. In this case, the loop exceeded the limit of 65536 iterations.

### How to Fix It:
1. **Add a Condition to Break the Loop**: Modify the loop to include a mechanism for updating or breaking the condition. This could be done by changing the value of `flag` based on some logic or input signal.
2. **Implement Time Delays**: If your intention is to toggle `out` over time, consider using a clocked process with a time delay or event control instead of a continuous `always @*` block.

Here's a possible revised version of the code:

```verilog
module top20(
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    output reg out
);

reg flag = 1'b1;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
begin
    if (reset)
        flag <= 1'b0;
    else if (flag)
        out <= ~out;
end

endmodule
```

### Explanation:
- **Clock Edge Triggering**: The process now triggers on the positive edge of `clk` or `reset`, ensuring that `out` toggles only on clock events.
- **Conditional Logic**: The `flag` can be reset or toggled using some control logic, allowing you to exit the toggling loop when desired.

This corrects the infinite loop issue by controlling when the toggling occurs, simultaneously adhering to good design practices in hardware description.
