The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-403] loop limit (65536) exceeded" is indicating that the while loop in the RTL code is causing an infinite loop. This error occurs because the condition `flag` within the while loop is not being updated inside the loop and remains always true. As a result, the loop keeps executing indefinitely, leading to a loop limit being exceeded during synthesis.

To fix this issue, you need to update the value of the `flag` variable inside the while loop to eventually exit the loop. Without modifying the flag or adding a condition to break out of the loop, the loop will continue infinitely. You should review the purpose of the `flag` variable and its intended behavior to determine the appropriate logic for breaking out of the loop.

In the given Verilog code snippet, the while loop may need to be restructured to ensure that the `flag` variable is updated within the loop, allowing the loop to terminate at some point based on the desired conditions.
