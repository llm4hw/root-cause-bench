### Issue Explanation:
1. **Infinite Combinational Loop**:  
   The `always @*` block is sensitive to any changes in its inputs (which include `flag` and `out`). However, the `while (flag)` loop runs indefinitely because:
   - `flag` is initialized to `1'b1` and **never modified** within the block.
   - The loop contains no timing control (e.g., `# delays`, clock edges) or exit condition.

2. **Synthesis Failure**:  
   During synthesis, tools attempt to "unroll" loops into hardware. Since the loop has no exit condition, the tool tries to unroll it infinitely, hitting the 65,536-iteration limit (a safeguard against hangs).

3. **Simulation Hang**:  
   In simulation, the loop would cause a hang because:
   - `out <= ~out` schedules a non-blocking assignment but **doesn't advance simulation time**.
   - The combinational block triggers repeatedly without pause, preventing time progression.

### Root Cause:
- **Combinational Logic Misuse**:  
  Combinational blocks (`always @*`) must resolve within **zero time** and describe purely combinational circuits. An infinite loop violates this by requiring infinite zero-time iterations.
- **No Clock or Timing Control**:  
  Continuous toggling of `out` requires sequential logic (clock-driven) to break the loop into discrete time steps.

### Fix Approach:
1. **Replace `while` with Sequential Logic**:  
   Use a clocked process (`always @(posedge clk)`) instead of combinational logic. This allows toggling `out` once per clock cycle.

2. **Add Loop Exit Condition**:  
   If toggling should stop, add logic to set `flag = 0` after a condition (e.g., after a counter limit).

3. **Avoid Combinational Loops**:  
   Ensure combinational blocks contain no unbounded loops or feedback paths without explicit exit conditions.

**Key Insight**: Hardware cannot instantiate infinite loopsâ€”all behavior must resolve in finite time or synchronize with a clock.
