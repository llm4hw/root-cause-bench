The error is caused by the infinite while loop in your always block. In your code, flag is always true, so the loop:

  while (flag) begin
   out <= ~out;
  end

never terminates. Because there is no delay or triggering event inside the loop, the simulator ends up trying to iterate it over 65,536 times (the built‐in safety limit) and then gives the error.

To fix the bug, you have two main options:

1. If you intended to toggle the output on a clock or at regular time intervals, remove the infinite loop and use a clocked procedural block (using the clock edge in the sensitivity list) so that the toggling occurs once per clock cycle. For example:

  always @(posedge clk) begin
   out <= ~out;
  end

2. If you must use a while loop (for example, in an initial block for simulation), then include a delay (like “#10” or an event control) inside the loop to allow time to progress and eventually exit the loop. However, note that using an infinite loop with delays can still lead to other simulation issues if not handled carefully.

The root cause is that the loop condition never changes (flag remains 1'b1), and without a delay the simulation never breaks out of the loop, leading to the loop limit being exceeded. The proper fix is to structure your code so that there is either a delay inside the loop or – ideally – change the design to use clocked logic rather than an infinite always‐@* loop.

Verilog provides the ability to stop a loop using the keyword disable. The disable function only works
on named statement groups. The disable function is typically used after a certain ﬁxed amount of time or
within a conditional construct such as an if-else or case statement that is triggered by a control signal....
