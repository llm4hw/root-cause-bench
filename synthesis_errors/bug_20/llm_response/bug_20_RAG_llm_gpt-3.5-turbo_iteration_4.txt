The error message indicates that the loop in the Verilog code has exceeded the limit of 65536 iterations, causing a synthesis error. In this specific case, the while loop in the always block is causing an infinite loop that does not have any condition to terminate.

To fix this issue, you can implement a time step event or delay within the loop to prevent it from hanging. One way to do this is by adding a delay using `#` inside the loop. Here's how you can modify the code to introduce a delay of 1 unit of time between each iteration of the loop:

```verilog
always @*
begin
    while (flag) begin
        out <= ~out;
        #1; // Adding a delay of 1 unit of time
    end
end
```

By adding the delay, the loop will now progress through iterations with a pause of 1 unit of time between each flipping of the `out` signal. This modification will prevent the infinite loop from occurring and causing a loop limit error during synthesis.

Verilog provides the ability to stop a loop using the keyword disable. The disable function only works
on named statement groups. The disable function is typically used after a certain ﬁxed amount of time or
