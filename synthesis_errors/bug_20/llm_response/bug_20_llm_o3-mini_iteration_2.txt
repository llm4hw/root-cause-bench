The issue here is that the synthesis (and simulation) tool is running into an endless loop because of the while loop. The condition in the while loop relies on a flag that is never modified within the loop‐it is constantly true. As a result, the tool attempts to unroll what is essentially an infinite combinational loop, which exceeds its internal loop limit (in this case, 65,536 iterations).

This infinite loop happens because the always block is sensitive to all signals (using “always @*”) and the loop never exits; there’s no change to the flag or any break condition that would allow the logic to continue beyond that point. The simulation error message is generated by the test bench because it detects that the combinational logic segment does not converge and instead spins indefinitely.

To fix the issue, the design should be modified so that the loop will eventually exit. This may involve restructuring the logic so that the flag is updated appropriately, or by using a clocked (sequential) process instead of a combinational always block—thereby ensuring that iterative processing is controlled over multiple clock cycles rather than being executed in one unbounded loop.

In summary:
• The bug is an infinite loop in a combinational always block caused by a while loop with a condition that never changes.
• It occurs because the flag remains true indefinitely, causing the loop to run endlessly until the tool’s loop unrolling limit is exceeded.
• The solution is to redesign the logic so that the while loop’s condition can eventually become false or to restructure the code as sequential logic controlled by a clock, ensuring that the iterative process completes as intended.
