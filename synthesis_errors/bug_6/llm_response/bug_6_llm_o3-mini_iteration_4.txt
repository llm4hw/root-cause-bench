The error occurs because the code declares a variable at the architecture level rather than inside a process or subprogram. In VHDL, variables are only allowed within processes, procedures, or functions—in other words, within a subprogram context—unless they are explicitly declared as shared. In your code, the variable "variable1" is declared outside of any process (at the same level as the signal). This violates VHDL's language rules, so the synthesis tool reports that the variable must either be declared as shared when it's outside a subprogram or, more typically, moved inside a process where variables are allowed.

This bug arises because VHDL treats signals and variables differently. Signals are intended for communication between different parts of the design and can be declared at the architecture level. Variables, on the other hand, are meant for local, sequential operations inside processes or subprograms. When you place a variable outside a process, the tool cannot treat it as a local, sequential object unless it is explicitly marked as shared—which carries different semantics and is not generally used in this context.

The fix is to change the placement of the variable declaration—moving it inside the process—or to replace it with a signal if it needs to be available across processes. This adjustment resolves the error because the variable will then be declared in a context that adheres to the language rules.
