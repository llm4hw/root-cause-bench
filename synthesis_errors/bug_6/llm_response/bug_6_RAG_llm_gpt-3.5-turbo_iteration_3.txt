The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-2858] variable outside of subprogram or process must be 'shared' [D:/chip chat/new_structure/bug_6/rtl/top6.vhd:42]" is occurring because in VHDL, variables declared at the architecture level (outside of a process or subprogram) need to be declared as shared. 

To fix this issue, you need to change the declaration of variable1 from a variable to a shared variable. Here is the corrected code snippet:

```vhdl
entity top6 is
    Port ( clk : in  STD_LOGIC;
           rst : in  STD_LOGIC;
           out1 : out STD_LOGIC);
end top6;

architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    shared variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Change variable to shared variable
begin
    process (clk, rst)
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';
            variable1 := '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            variable1 := signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

By changing the variable declaration to a shared variable, you ensure that it can be used outside of processes and subprograms at the architecture level without causing synthesis errors.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
