The bug in the provided code is due to the usage of a variable (`variable1`) outside of a process or subprogram that is not declared as `shared`. In VHDL, variables declared at the architecture level are only allowed to be accessed within processes or function procedures unless marked as `shared`. 

In this case, the variable `variable1` is declared at the architecture level and is being assigned and read directly within the process, which is not allowed in VHDL.

To fix this issue, you can either move the variable declaration inside the process where it is being used or mark it as `shared` to make it accessible from the architecture level. This will resolve the error related to the variable being outside of a subprogram or process without being marked as shared.
