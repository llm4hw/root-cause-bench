The bug occurs because the variable `variable1` is declared in the architecture's declarative region (outside any process) without being declared as a `shared` variable, violating VHDL rules.

**Why this occurs:**
1. VHDL requires variables declared outside subprograms/processes to be explicitly marked as `shared` (IEEE Std 1076-2008, §10.6.2).
2. The current declaration (`variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';`) is illegal because:
   - It's not inside a process
   - It lacks the `shared` keyword
   - Shared variables are complex and discouraged for typical designs

**Fix:**
Move the variable declaration **inside** the process where it's used:
```vhdl
process (clk, rst)
    variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Now local to process
begin
    if rst = '1' then
        signal1 <= '0';
        variable1 := '0'; 
    elsif rising_edge(clk) then
        variable1 := signal1;
    end if;
end process;
```

**Key changes:**
1. Removed `variable1` from architecture declarations
2. Added declaration inside the process before `begin`
3. Maintained initialization value (`:= '0'`)

**Why this works:**
- Variables inside processes are:
  - Local to that process
  - Synthesizable as registers (if assigned conditionally)
  - Follow standard VHDL scoping rules
- Eliminates the need for problematic shared variables

**Additional notes:**
1. The unused `variable1` (assigned but never read) should be removed entirely if not needed
2. Signals (like `signal1`) should be used for inter-process communication
3. Shared variables require special synchronization and are rarely needed in RTL design

Fixed code structure:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
begin
    process (clk, rst)
        variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Correct placement
    begin
        -- Process logic...
    end process;
    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
