The error message says that you have declared a variable outside of a process (or subprogram) without marking it as "shared," which is not allowed by the VHDL language rules. In your architecture, you declared

  variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';

directly in the declarative region of the architecture. VHDL only permits variable declarations inside processes (or functions/procedures) unless you specifically declare them as shared. Since shared variables have extra implications for concurrency and are rarely the intended design method, the usual fix is to move the variable declaration inside the process where it’s used.

To fix the problem, you can move the declaration of variable1 inside the process block:

  process (clk, rst)
   variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
  begin
   if rst = '1' then
    signal1 <= '0';
    variable1 := '0';
   elsif rising_edge(clk) then
    variable1 := signal1;
   end if;
  end process;

This change places variable1 within the scope of the process and resolves the error since variables are allowed inside procedural blocks without being shared.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
