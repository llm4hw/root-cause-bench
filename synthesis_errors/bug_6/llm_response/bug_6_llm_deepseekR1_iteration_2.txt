### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because the variable `variable1` is declared in the architecture's declarative region (outside any process or subprogram). In VHDL, variables must be **local to a process, function, or procedure**. Variables declared in an architecture's declarative region must use the `shared` keyword (for shared variables), but this is rarely appropriate for typical design patterns and can lead to non-deterministic behavior.

### Why It's Happening:
1. **VHDL Scoping Rules**:  
   Variables are designed for temporary storage within sequential code blocks (processes/subprograms). They cannot exist freely in the architecture declarative region like signals.
   
2. **Synthesis Limitation**:  
   The synthesis tool flags this because hardware implementation requires clear scope for variables. Variables outside processes imply undefined behavior for registers/combinational logic.

3. **Usage Context**:  
   `variable1` is only accessed inside the `process(clk, rst)`, confirming it should be local to that process.

### How to Fix:
1. **Move the variable declaration** inside the process where it's used:  
   ```vhdl
   process (clk, rst)
     variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Correct placement
   begin
     ...
   end process;
   ```

2. **Remove the global declaration** of `variable1` from the architecture body.

### Additional Note:
The initialization `:= '0'` for the variable inside the process is valid and synthesizable. It ensures `variable1` starts at `'0'` during simulation. The reset logic (`rst = '1'`) will override it when needed, matching typical hardware reset behavior.
