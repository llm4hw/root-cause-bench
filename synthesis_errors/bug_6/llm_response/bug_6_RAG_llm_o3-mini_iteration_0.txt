The bug is that you declared a variable (variable1) outside any process or subprogram. In VHDL, variables are only allowed inside a process, function, or procedure (or must be declared as a shared variable in a package/architecture). The error message complains that a variable declared outside a subprogram must be marked as shared.

Why it's occurring:
• In VHDL, variables are meant to be used for sequential assignments and are local to a process or subprogram.
• Outside these regions (at the architecture level), you must either declare a signal for concurrent behavior or, if you really want a variable, declare it as a "shared variable" (which is rarely what you want in synthesizable code).
• The tool (test bench simulator) finds the variable declaration in the architecture section and complains because it is not inside a process.

How to fix:
• Move the variable declaration inside the process that uses it. For example:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  architecture Behavioral of top6 is
      signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
  begin
      process (clk, rst)
          variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- now inside the process
      begin
          if rst = '1' then
              signal1 <= '0';
              variable1 := '0'; 
          elsif rising_edge(clk) then
              variable1 := signal1;
          end if;
      end process;
  
      out1 <= signal1;
  end Behavioral;
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

• Alternatively, if you intend to have concurrent behavior, convert variable1 to a signal if that fits your design needs.

By moving the variable declaration inside the process (or converting it to a signal), you eliminate the error and conform to VHDL rules.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
