### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because the variable `variable1` is declared in the **architecture's declarative region** (between `architecture` and `begin`), which violates VHDL's scoping rules. 

#### Why this is invalid:
1. **Variables in architecture scope must be SHARED**:  
   VHDL requires that variables declared outside processes or subprograms must be explicitly marked as `shared`. This is because such variables could potentially be accessed by multiple processes concurrently, requiring special handling.  
   *Your code declares `variable1` without the `shared` keyword*.

2. **Variables belong inside processes/subprograms**:  
   Regular (non-shared) variables can **only** be declared:  
   - Inside a `process` (before the `begin` of the process)  
   - Inside a `function` or `procedure`  
   *Your declaration is in the architecture body, which is illegal*.

3. **Synthesis limitation**:  
   Synthesis tools (like Xilinx Vivado) reject this construct because shared variables introduce non-deterministic behavior in hardware and are generally unsynthesizable.

### How to Fix:
#### Option 1 (Recommended): Move the variable inside the process  
Declare `variable1` **within the process** that uses it:  
```vhdl
process (clk, rst)
    variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Declare INSIDE the process
begin
    ... 
end process;
```  
This makes it a local process variable, aligning with VHDL rules.

#### Option 2: Replace with a signal  
If cross-process communication is needed, use a `signal` instead of a variable:  
```vhdl
signal signal1, variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Declare as signal
```  
Signals can be freely declared in the architecture region and assigned in processes with `<=`.

#### Option 3 (Not Recommended): Use SHARED variable  
If truly needed (rarely synthesizable), declare as:  
```vhdl
shared variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
```  
*Note: Shared variables are discouraged in RTL design due to race conditions and tool support issues.*

### Root Cause Summary:  
The variable `variable1` is illegally placed in the architecture declarative region without being `shared`. VHDL restricts variables to processes/subprograms unless explicitly declared as shared. The fix requires either relocating the variable or changing its declaration type.
