The error message "ERROR: [Synth 8-2858] variable outside of subprogram or process must be 'shared'" is occurring because variable1 is declared as a variable type within the architecture Behavioral of top6, outside of any process or subprogram block. In Verilog, variables like variable1 cannot exist outside of a process block or a function.

To fix this issue, you should move the declaration of variable1 inside the process block. Here is the modified code snippet with the variable declaration inside the process block:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';

begin
    process (clk, rst)
    variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';
            variable1 := '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            variable1 := signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

By moving the variable declaration inside the process block, you ensure that variable1 is local to the process and adheres to the rules of declaring variables in Verilog.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
