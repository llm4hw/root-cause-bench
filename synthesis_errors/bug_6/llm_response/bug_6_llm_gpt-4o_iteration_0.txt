The error message indicates that there is a problem with the declaration of `variable1` in the VHDL architecture. In VHDL, variables can only be declared inside processes, functions, or procedures, not directly within an architecture, like signals. The error occurs because `variable1` is declared at the architecture level rather than inside a specific process or subprogram.

In VHDL, signals and variables have different roles and scopes. Signals are globally accessible within an architecture and are used for communication across different processes, while variables are local to the process or subprogram where they are declared. They are used for temporary storage and computation within that specific scope.

The root cause of the problem is that the `variable1` is declared outside any process or subprogram, violating the VHDL rules for variable scope. Since VHDL expects variables to be local, it requires them to be shared if they are declared outside a process to denote shared access across multiple processes, but generally, such shared variables are highly discouraged due to potential race conditions and complexity.

To fix the issue, `variable1` should be declared inside the process where it is used. Declaring `variable1` inside the process ensures it remains local to that process, which is consistent with VHDL's proper usage of variables. By moving the variable declaration into the process, the synthesis tool can correctly interpret and simulate the intended behavior without error.

By making this adjustment, you would avoid the error and achieve the desired simulation or synthesis result.
