The error message you are encountering is due to the misuse of the `variable` construct in VHDL. In VHDL, variables need to be declared inside a process, procedure, or function. In your code, the variable `variable1` is declared outside of the process and is not marked as `shared`, which causes the error.

**Root Cause:**
- VHDL requires that any variable used inside a process is declared within that process or subprogram, unless it's meant to be shared across different processes, in which case it must be declared as `shared`.

**How to Fix:**
- Move the declaration of `variable1` inside the process block where it is being used. This would ensure proper encapsulation and adherence to VHDL syntax rules. Here's how you can modify your code:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
begin
    process (clk, rst)
        variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- Move the variable declaration inside the process
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';
            variable1 := '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            variable1 := signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

**Why it Occurs:**
- In VHDL, variables have to be managed within processes or subprograms to maintain local scope and avoid ambiguity in concurrent designs. This rule helps VHDL simulators and synthesis tools ensure proper usage and analysis of variables for simulation and hardware synthesis.

By moving the `variable1` declaration inside the process, it becomes a local variable with a clear scope, resolving the error.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
