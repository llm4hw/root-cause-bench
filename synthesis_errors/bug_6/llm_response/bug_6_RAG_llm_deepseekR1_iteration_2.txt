### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because **variables in VHDL must be declared inside a process or subprogram**. In your code, `variable1` is declared in the architecture body (outside any process), which violates VHDL's scoping rules.

### Why This Happens
1. **VHDL Variable Scope**: 
   - Variables can only be declared **inside processes, functions, or procedures**.
   - Declaring them in the architecture body (like signals) is invalid unless they're `shared variables` (which require protected types and are rarely used).

2. **Tool Enforcement**:  
   Synthesis tools like Xilinx Vivado enforce this rule strictly, leading to the error:  
   > `variable outside of subprogram or process must be 'shared'`

### Fix
Move the variable declaration **inside the process** where it's used:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Signal remains here
begin
    process (clk, rst)
        variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Moved INSIDE the process
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';
            variable1 := '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            variable1 := signal1;  -- Example usage
        end if;
    end process;
    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

### Key Differences
| **Original (Bug)** | **Fixed Code** |
|---------------------|----------------|
| `variable` declared in architecture body | `variable` declared inside `process` |
| Illegal scoping | Legal scoping |
| Synthesis fails | Synthesis passes |

### Additional Notes
- **Signals vs. Variables**:  
  Signals (declared in architecture) represent hardware wires/registers. Variables (inside processes) are temporary software-like storage.
- **Initial Values**:  
  The initialization (`:= '0'`) is synthesizable for FPGAs but ignored for ASICs. Remove it if non-synthesizable simulation is a concern.

This fix resolves the synthesis error while maintaining the intended functionality.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block

assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
