The error message indicates that the variable `variable1` is outside of a subprogram or process and must be declared as 'shared' when used at the architecture level. However, in your provided code, the declaration of `variable1` seems technically correct as it is declared inside the architecture and used within the process.

The misunderstanding here lies in the usage and placement of variable declarations in VHDL:
- In VHDL, variables should typically be declared inside a process, function, or procedure. This means they are not supposed to be declared at the architecture level directly unless they are explicitly 'shared' (which is a less common requirement and usage, not applicable to standard digital logic design).

In your architecture:
1. Move the declaration of `variable1` from the architecture to inside the process. This allows its usage within the process where it is being updated.

Corrected code snippet within the architecture:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
begin
    process (clk, rst)
        variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Move the variable declaration here
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';
            variable1 := '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            variable1 := signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

By moving the variable declaration inside the process, you ensure the scope of `variable1` is restricted to the process, complying with standard VHDL usage and resolving the error during synthesis. Additionally, remember that variables update immediately and do not have the delta delay like signals, so be careful with their use inside sequential logic.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
