The error message you've encountered indicates that a "variable" declaration is improperly placed outside of a subprogram (such as a function) or a process (like a procedure or an entire architecture) in the VHDL code. In the given code, the variable `variable1` is declared directly within the architecture, which is causing the synthesis tool to raise an error.

In VHDL, variables must be declared within a process or a subprogram, not at the architecture level or directly outside these constructs. In the behavioral architecture of your design, `variable1` is mistakenly declared outside of the process. This is why the error message suggests that variables outside of a process must be `shared` — but this is typically not what you need here. The variable should be inside the process to allow its correct usage and simulation.

### Fix:

Move the declaration of `variable1` inside the process where it is being used. Here is how you can fix the code:

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';
begin
    process (clk, rst)
        variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0'; -- move the declaration inside the process
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';
            variable1 := '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            variable1 := signal1;
        end if;
    end process;

    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Declaration:** By declaring `variable1` inside the process, you ensure it is correctly recognized and behaves as intended during simulation. Variables in VHDL are meant to be used inside processes to temporarily store values within one execution of the process.

2. **Behaviour:** Now, `variable1` will correctly hold a value until the process is next triggered, mimicking the behavior typical of software variables, i.e., losing its value when the process completes unless stored back to a signal.

This revision abides by the rules of VHDL, resolving your error and allowing the code to simulate without the given error message.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

Design a Verilog test bench to verify the func-
tional operation of the system in Fig. 6.1. Your
test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
“0010,” . . .). Your test bench should use a pro-
cedural
block
and
individual
signal
assignments for each pattern. Your test bench
should change the input pattern every 10 ns.
