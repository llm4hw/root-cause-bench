Based on the error message and the provided code, the issue is related to the **placement of the variable declaration in VHDL**. Here's the breakdown:

### Bug Explanation
1. **Illegal Variable Declaration**:  
   The line `variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';` is declared in the **architecture's declarative region** (outside any process/subprogram).  
   In VHDL:
   - `variable` can **only be declared inside processes, functions, or procedures** (subprograms).
   - Signals (`signal`) can be declared in the architecture region, but variables cannot.

2. **Error Message Meaning**:  
   The synthesis error `variable outside of subprogram or process must be 'shared'` indicates that:
   - Variables in architecture regions must use the `shared variable` type (for multi-driver scenarios).
   - Your code uses a regular variable (`variable`) illegally in the architecture region.

### Why This Occurs
- VHDL strictly segregates **signals** (global to architecture, use `<=` for assignment) and **variables** (local to processes, use `:=` for assignment).
- The variable `variable1` is incorrectly placed in the architecture body, violating VHDL's scoping rules.

### Fix
**Move the variable declaration inside the process** where it's used:  
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of top6 is
    signal signal1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- Stays here (correct for signals)
begin
    process (clk, rst)
        variable variable1 : STD_LOGIC := '0';  -- MOVED INSIDE THE PROCESS
    begin
        if rst = '1' then
            signal1 <= '0';
            variable1 := '0'; 
        elsif rising_edge(clk) then
            variable1 := signal1;  -- Variable assignment remains
        end if;
    end process;
    out1 <= signal1;
end Behavioral;
```

### Key Changes
1. **Relocated Variable**:  
   `variable1` is now declared inside the `process`, making it local to the process.
2. **No Shared Variable Needed**:  
   Since `variable1` is only accessed within one process, `shared variable` is unnecessary (and discouraged due to non-determinism risks).

### Why This Fix Works
- Variables must be **local to the process** that uses them.  
- Signals (like `signal1`) can be declared in the architecture and accessed by multiple processes.  

### Additional Notes
- **Initialization**: `:= '0'` for the variable is acceptable but note that synthesis tools often ignore initial values. Ensure your reset logic handles initialization (which your reset clause already does).
- **Unused Variable Warning**: After fixing, you might get a warning that `variable1` is unused (since it's assigned but never read). This is a separate logic issue but doesn't break synthesis.

This change resolves the synthesis error while adhering to VHDL's scoping rules.

Variable Data Types  
  
Variable data types are used for programming storage in procedural blocks.
• Variables store logic values only, they do not store logic strength.
• A variable data type must be used when the signal is on the left-hand side
of a procedural assignment.
• Variables were called “registers” in older versions of the Verilog standard. 
• variable_type is one of the following:...

- source_documents\verilog_fsm.pdf: case with simulation tools (like ModelSim), however. ModelSim will not correct your sensitivity
list bugs, and your simulations will be plagued with odd errors. Furthermore, the synthesis tools
catching your errors is not guarenteed. An easy way to avoid these potential problems is to use
always@( * ) as opposed to always@(Input1 or Input 2 or ...).

Now the program memory can be declared as an array type with initial values to deﬁne the program.
The following Verilog shows how to declare the program memory and an example program to perform a
load, store, and a branch always. This program will continually write x“AA” to port_out_00.

test bench should drive in each input code for
the vector ABCD in the order they would
appear in a truth table (i.e., “0000,” “0001,”
